Unlike cond and condp, case does a constant-time dispatch, the clauses are not considered sequentially.  All manner of constant expressions are acceptable in case, including numbers, strings, symbols, keywords, and (Clojure) composites thereof. Note that since lists are used to group multiple constants that map to the same expression, a vector can be used to match a list if needed. The test-constants need not be all of the same type.")

("comment" . "(comment & body) Ignores body, yields nil")
("commute" . "(commute ref fun & args) Must be called in a transaction. Sets the in-transaction-value of ref to:  (apply fun in-transaction-value-of-ref args)  and returns the in-transaction-value of ref.  At the commit point of the transaction, sets the value of ref to be:  (apply fun most-recently-committed-value-of-ref args)  Thus fun should be commutative, or, failing that, you must accept last-one-in-wins behavior.  commute allows for more concurrency than ref-set.")

("cond" . "(cond & clauses) Takes a set of test/expr pairs. It evaluates each test one at a time.  If a test returns logical true, cond evaluates and returns the value of the corresponding expr and doesn't evaluate any of the other tests or exprs. (cond) returns nil.")
("condp" . "(condp pred expr & clauses) Takes a binary predicate, an expression, and a set of clauses. Each clause can take the form of either:  test-expr result-expr  test-expr :>> result-fn  Note :>> is an ordinary keyword.  For each clause, (pred test-expr expr) is evaluated. If it returns logical true, the clause is a match. If a binary clause matches, the result-expr is returned, if a ternary clause matches, its result-fn, which must be a unary function, is called with the result of the predicate as its argument, the result of that call being the return value of condp. A single default expression can follow the clauses, and its value will be returned if no clause matches. If no default expression is provided and no clause matches, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.")

("contains?" . "(contains? coll key) Returns true if key is present in the given collection, otherwise returns false.  Note that for numerically indexed collections like vectors and Java arrays, this tests if the numeric key is within the range of indexes. 'contains?' operates constant or logarithmic time; it will not perform a linear search for a value.  See also 'some'.")
("count" . "(count coll) Returns the number of items in the collection. (count nil) returns 0.  Also works on strings, arrays, and Java Collections and Maps")
("counted?" . "(counted? coll) Returns true if coll implements count in constant time")

("defonce" . "(defonce name expr) defs name to have the root value of the expr iff the named var has no root value, else expr is unevaluated")
("defprotocol" . "(defprotocol name & opts+sigs) A protocol is a named set of named methods and their signatures: (defprotocol AProtocolName    ;optional doc string   \"A doc string for AProtocol abstraction\"  ;method signatures   (bar [this a b] \"bar docs\")   (baz [this a] [this a b] [this a b c] \"baz docs\"))  No implementations are provided. Docs can be specified for the protocol overall and for each method. The above yields a set of polymorphic functions and a protocol object. All are namespace-qualified by the ns enclosing the definition The resulting functions dispatch on the type of their first argument, which is required and corresponds to the implicit target object ('this' in  Java parlance). defprotocol is dynamic, has no special compile-time  effect, and defines no new types or classes. Implementations of  the protocol methods can be provided using extend.  defprotocol will automatically generate a corresponding interface, with the same name as the protocol, i.e. given a protocol: my.ns/Protocol, an interface: my.ns.Protocol. The interface will have methods corresponding to the protocol functions, and the protocol will automatically work with instances of the interface.  Note that you should not use this interface with deftype or reify, as they support the protocol directly:  (defprotocol P    (foo [this])    (bar-me [this] [this y]))  (deftype Foo [a b c]   P   (foo [this] a)   (bar-me [this] b)   (bar-me [this y] (+ c y)))  (bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42) => 45  (foo    (let [x 42]     (reify P        (foo [this] 17)       (bar-me [this] x)       (bar-me [this y] x)))) => 17")
("defrecord" . "(defrecord name [& fields] & opts+specs) Alpha - subject to change  (defrecord name [fields*]  options* specs*)  Currently there are no options.  Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero or more method bodies:  protocol-or-interface-or-Object (methodName [args*] body)*  Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or interfaces.  The class will have the (immutable) fields named by fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those declared in the protocols/interfaces.  Note that method bodies are not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields, and those fields can be accessed directy.  Method definitions take the form:  (methodname [args*] body)  The argument and return types can be hinted on the arg and methodname symbols. If not supplied, they will be inferred, so type hints should be reserved for disambiguation.  Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for methods of Object. Note that a parameter must be supplied to correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied automatically and can not be substituted.  In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the class (for calls to new, instance? etc).  The class will have implementations of several (clojure.lang) interfaces generated automatically: IObj (metadata support) and IPersistentMap, and all of their superinterfaces.  In addition, defrecord will define type-and-value-based =, and will defined Java .hashCode and .equals consistent with the contract for java.util.Map.  When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory.  Two constructors will be defined, one taking the designated fields followed by a metadata map (nil for none) and an extension field map (nil for none), and one taking only the fields (using nil for meta and extension fields).")

The only methods that can be supplied are those declared in the protocols/interfaces.  Note that method bodies are not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields, and those fields can be accessed directy. Fields can be qualified with the metadata :volatile-mutable true or :unsynchronized-mutable true, at which point (set! afield aval) will be supported in method bodies. Note well that mutable fields are extremely difficult to use correctly, and are present only to facilitate the building of higher level constructs, such as Clojure's reference types, in Clojure itself. They are for experts only - if the semantics and implications of :volatile-mutable or :unsynchronized-mutable are not immediately apparent to you, you should not be using them.

([a b] ...)...)}    BProtocol       {...}     ...)   extend takes a type/class (or interface, see below), and one or more  protocol + method map pairs. It will extend the polymorphism of the  protocol's methods to call the supplied methods when an AType is  provided as the first argument.    Method maps are maps of the keyword-ized method names to ordinary  fns. This facilitates easy reuse of existing fns and fn maps, for  code reuse/mixins without derivation or composition. You can extend  an interface to a protocol. This is primarily to facilitate interop  with the host (e.g. Java) but opens the door to incidental multiple  inheritance of implementation since a class can inherit from more  than one interface, both of which extend the protocol. It is TBD how  to specify which impl to use. You can extend a protocol on nil.   If you are supplying the definitions explicitly (i.e. not reusing  exsting functions or mixin maps), you may find it more convenient to  use the extend-type or extend-protocol macros.   Note that multiple independent extend clauses can exist for the same  type, not all protocols need be defined in a single extend call.   See also:  extends?, satisfies?, extenders")
("extend-protocol" . "(extend-protocol p & specs) Useful when you want to provide several implementations of the same protocol all at once. Takes a single protocol and the implementation of that protocol for one or more types. Expands into calls to extend-type:  (extend-protocol Protocol   AType     (foo [x] ...)     (bar [x y] ...)

("gen-class" . "(gen-class & options) When compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the given package-qualified :name (which, as all names in these parameters, can be a string or symbol), and writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory.  When not compiling, does nothing. The gen-class construct contains no implementation, as the implementation will be dynamically sought by the generated class in functions in an implementing Clojure namespace. Given a generated class org.mydomain.MyClass with a method named mymethod, gen-class will generate an implementation that looks for a function named by  (str prefix mymethod) (default prefix: \"-\") in a Clojure namespace specified by :impl-ns (defaults to the current namespace). All inherited methods, generated methods, and init and main functions (see :methods, :init, and :main below) will be found similarly prefixed. By default, the static initializer for the generated class will attempt to load the Clojure support code for the class as a resource from the classpath, e.g. in the example case, ``org/mydomain/MyClass__init.class``. This behavior can be controlled by :load-impl-ns  Note that methods with a maximum of 18 parameters are supported.  In all subsequent sections taking types, the primitive types can be referred to by their Java names (int, float etc), and classes in the java.lang package can be used without a package qualifier. All other classes must be fully qualified.  Options should be a set of key/value pairs, all except for :name are optional:  :name aname  The package-qualified name of the class to be generated  :extends aclass  Specifies the superclass, the non-private methods of which will be overridden by the class. If not provided, defaults to Object.  :implements [interface ...]  One or more interfaces, the methods of which will be implemented by the class.  :init name  If supplied, names a function that will be called with the arguments to the constructor. Must return [ [superclass-constructor-args] state]  If not supplied, the constructor args are passed directly to the superclass constructor and the state will be nil  :constructors {[param-types] [super-param-types], ...}  By default, constructors are created for the generated class which match the signature(s) of the constructors for the superclass. This parameter may be used to explicitly specify constructors, each entry providing a mapping from a constructor signature to a superclass constructor signature. When you supply this, you must supply an :init specifier.   :post-init name  If supplied, names a function that will be called with the object as the first argument, followed by the arguments to the constructor. It will be called every time an object of this class is created, immediately after all the inherited constructors have completed. It's return value is ignored.  :methods [ [name [param-types] return-type], ...]  The generated class automatically defines all of the non-private methods of its superclasses/interfaces. This parameter can be used to specify the signatures of additional methods of the generated class. Static methods can be specified with ^{:static true} in the signature's metadata. Do not repeat superclass/interface signatures here.  :main boolean  If supplied and true, a static public main function will be generated. It will pass each string of the String[] argument as a separate argument to a function called (str prefix main).  :factory name  If supplied, a (set of) public static factory function(s) will be created with the given name, and the same signature(s) as the constructor(s).  :state name  If supplied, a public final instance field with the given name will be created. You must supply an :init function in order to provide a value for the state. Note that, though final, the state can be a ref or agent, supporting the creation of Java objects with transactional or asynchronous mutation semantics.  :exposes {protected-field-name {:get name :set name}, ...}  Since the implementations of the methods of the generated class occur in Clojure functions, they have no access to the inherited protected fields of the superclass. This parameter can be used to generate public getter/setter methods exposing the protected field(s) for use in the implementation.  :exposes-methods {super-method-name exposed-name, ...}  It is sometimes necessary to call the superclass' implementation of an overridden method.  Those methods may be exposed and referred in  the new method implementation by a local name.  :prefix string  Default: \"-\" Methods called e.g. Foo will be looked up in vars called prefixFoo in the implementing ns.  :impl-ns name  Default: the name of the current ns. Implementations of methods will be  looked up in this namespace.  :load-impl-ns boolean  Default: true. Causes the static initializer for the generated class to reference the load code for the implementing namespace. Should be true when implementing-ns is the default, false if you intend to load the code via some other method.")

("reify" . "(reify & opts+specs) reify is a macro with the following structure:  (reify options* specs*)    Currently there are no options.   Each spec consists of the protocol or interface name followed by zero  or more method bodies:   protocol-or-interface-or-Object  (methodName [args+] body)*   Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired  protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for  methods of Object. Note that the first parameter must be supplied to  correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus  methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the  interface declarations.  Note also that recur calls to the method  head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied  automatically and can not be substituted.   The return type can be indicated by a type hint on the method name,  and arg types can be indicated by a type hint on arg names. If you  leave out all hints, reify will try to match on same name/arity  method in the protocol(s)/interface(s) - this is preferred. If you  supply any hints at all, no inference is done, so all hints (or  default of Object) must be correct, for both arguments and return  type. If a method is overloaded in a protocol/interface, multiple  independent method definitions must be supplied.  If overloaded with  same arity in an interface you must specify complete hints to  disambiguate - a missing hint implies Object.   recur works to method heads The method bodies of reify are lexical  closures, and can refer to the surrounding local scope:    (str (let [f \"foo\"]        (reify Object          (toString [this] f))))  == \"foo\"   (seq (let [f \"foo\"]        (reify clojure.lang.Seqable          (seq [this] (seq f)))))  == (\f \o \o))")

("require" . "(require & args) Loads libs, skipping any that are already loaded. Each argument is either a libspec that identifies a lib, a prefix list that identifies multiple libs whose names share a common prefix, or a flag that modifies how all the identified libs are loaded. Use :require in the ns macro in preference to calling this directly.  Libs  A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents define a library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is associated with a Clojure namespace and a Java package that share its name. A lib's name also locates its root directory within classpath using Java's package name to classpath-relative path mapping. All resources in a lib should be contained in the directory structure under its root directory. All definitions a lib makes should be in its associated namespace.  'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource path is derived from the lib name in the following manner: Consider a lib named by the symbol 'x.y.z; it has the root directory <classpath>/x/y/, and its root resource is <classpath>/x/y/z.clj. The root resource should contain code to create the lib's namespace (usually by using the ns macro) and load any additional lib resources.  Libspecs  A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.  Recognized options: :as :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the   lib's namespace in the current namespace.  Prefix Lists  It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to reduce repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by libspecs with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After removing the prefix, the names that remain must not contain any periods.  Flags  A flag is a keyword. Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are   already loaded :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the   identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and refer  Example:  The following would load the libraries clojure.zip and clojure.set abbreviated as 's'.  (require '(clojure zip [set :as s]))")
