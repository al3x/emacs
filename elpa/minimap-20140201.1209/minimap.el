;;; Commentary:

;; Heavily based off minimap.el by David Engster however I
;; have refactored it a bit to support only a single global
;; minimap window. Usually this should be opened on startup
;; when there is a single window. Some defaults have also 
;; been changed.

;; This file is an implementation of a minimap sidebar, i.e., a
;; smaller display of the current buffer on the left side. It
;; highlights the currently shown region and updates its position
;; automatically. You can navigate in the minibar by dragging the
;; active region with the mouse, which will scroll the corresponding
;; edit buffer.

;; Usage:
;;  * Put minimap.el in your load path.
;;  * (require 'minimap)
;;  * Use 'M-x minimap-toggle' to toggle the minimap.
;;  * Use 'M-x minimap-create' to create the minimap.
;;  * Use 'M-x minimap-kill' to kill the minimap.
;;  * Use 'M-x customize-group RET minimap RET' to adapt minimap to your needs.
