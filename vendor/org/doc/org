1.1 Summary
===========

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

   Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org is implemented
on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor.  Org supports TODO items, deadlines, timestamps, and
scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda that
utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages,
BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.  For printing and
sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a structured ASCII
file, as HTML, or (TODO and agenda items only) as an iCalendar file.
It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of linked web pages.

   An important design aspect that distinguishes Org from, for example,
Planner/Muse is that it encourages you to store every piece of
information only once.  In Planner, you have project pages, day pages
and possibly other files, duplicating some information such as tasks.
In Org, you only have notes files.  In your notes you mark entries as
tasks, and label them with tags and timestamps.  All necessary lists,
like a schedule for the day, the agenda for a meeting, tasks lists
selected by tags, etc., are created dynamically when you need them.

   Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should feel
like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways, for example as:

     * an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
     * an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
     * an ASCII table editor with spreadsheet-like capabilities
     * a TODO list editor
     * a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
     * an environment to implement David Allen's GTD system
     * a basic database application
     * a simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
     * a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages

   Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org with the
minor Orgstruct mode.

   There is a website for Org which provides links to the newest
version of Org, as well as additional information, frequently asked
questions (FAQ), links to tutorials, etc.  This page is located at
`http://orgmode.org'.


File: org,  Node: Installation,  Next: Activation,  Prev: Summary,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Installation
================

Important: If you are using a version of Org that is part of the Emacs
distribution or an XEmacs package, please skip this section and go
directly to *note Activation::.

   If you have downloaded Org from the Web, either as a distribution
`.zip' or `.tar' file, or as a Git archive, you must take the following
steps to install it: go into the unpacked Org distribution directory
and edit the top section of the file `Makefile'.  You must set the name
of the Emacs binary (likely either `emacs' or `xemacs'), and the paths
to the directories where local Lisp and Info files are kept.  If you
don't have access to the system-wide directories, you can simply run
Org directly from the distribution directory by adding the `lisp'
subdirectory to the Emacs load path.  To do this, add the following
line to `.emacs':

     (setq load-path (cons "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp" load-path))

If you plan to use code from the `contrib' subdirectory, do a similar
step for this directory:

     (setq load-path (cons "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" load-path))



   XEmacs users now need to install the file `noutline.el' from the
`xemacs' sub-directory of the Org distribution.  Use the command:

          make install-noutline



Now byte-compile the Lisp files with the shell command:

     make

If you are running Org from the distribution directory, this is all.
If you want to install Org into the system directories, use (as
administrator)

     make install

   Installing Info files is system dependent, because of differences in
the `install-info' program.  In Debian it copies the info files into the
correct directory and modifies the info directory file.  In many other
systems, the files need to be copied to the correct directory
separately, and `install-info' then only modifies the directory file.
Check your system documentation to find out which of the following
commands you need:

     make install-info
     make install-info-debian

   Then add the following line to `.emacs'.  It is needed so that Emacs
can autoload functions that are located in files not immediately loaded
when Org-mode starts.
     (require 'org-install)

   Do not forget to activate Org as described in the following section.


File: org,  Node: Activation,  Next: Feedback,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Activation
==============

Add the following lines to your `.emacs' file.  The last three lines
define _global_ keys for the commands `org-store-link', `org-agenda',
and `org-iswitchb'--please choose suitable keys yourself.

     ;; The following lines are always needed.  Choose your own keys.
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
     (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
     (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
     (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)

   Furthermore, you must activate `font-lock-mode' in Org buffers,
because significant functionality depends on font-locking being active.
You can do this with either one of the following two lines (XEmacs
users must use the second option):
     (global-font-lock-mode 1)                     ; for all buffers
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)  ; Org buffers only

   With this setup, all files with extension `.org' will be put into
Org mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look like
this:

     MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-

which will select Org mode for this buffer no matter what the file's
name is.  See also the variable `org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file'.

   Many commands in Org work on the region if the region is active.  To
make use of this, you need to have `transient-mark-mode'
(`zmacs-regions' in XEmacs) turned on.  In Emacs 23 this is the default,
in Emacs 22 you need to do this yourself with
     (transient-mark-mode 1)
   If you do not like `transient-mark-mode', you can create an active
region by using the mouse to select a region, or pressing `C-<SPC>'
twice before moving the cursor.

1.4 Feedback
============

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or
ideas about it, please mail to the Org mailing list
<emacs-orgmode@gnu.org>.  If you are not a member of the mailing list,
your mail will be passed to the list after a moderator has approved it.

   For bug reports, please provide as much information as possible,
including the version information of Emacs (`M-x emacs-version <RET>')
and Org (`M-x org-version <RET>'), as well as the Org related setup in
`.emacs'.  The easiest way to do this is to use the command
     M-x org-submit-bug-report
   which will put all this information into an Emacs mail buffer so
that you only need to add your description.  If you re not sending the
Email from within Emacs, please copy and paste the content into your
Email program.

   If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see below on how
to create one).  Often a small example file helps, along with clear
information about:

  1. What exactly did you do?

  2. What did you expect to happen?

  3. What happened instead?
        Thank you for helping to improve this mode.

How to create a useful backtrace
................................

If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a _backtrace_.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

  1. Reload uncompiled versions of all Org-mode Lisp files.  The
     backtrace contains much more information if it is produced with
     uncompiled code.  To do this, use
          C-u M-x org-reload RET
     or select `Org -> Refresh/Reload -> Reload Org uncompiled' from the
     menu.

  2. Go to the `Options' menu and select `Enter Debugger on Error'
     (XEmacs has this option in the `Troubleshooting' sub-menu).

  3. Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
     document the steps you take.

  4. When you hit the error, a `*Backtrace*' buffer will appear on the
     screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using `C-x C-w')
     and attach it to your bug report.

1.5 Typesetting conventions used in this manual
===============================================

Org uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags, and property
names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:

`TODO'
`WAITING'
     TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are
     user-defined.

`boss'
`ARCHIVE'
     User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in tags with
     special meaning are written with all capitals.

`Release'
`PRIORITY'
     User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with
     special meaning are written with all capitals.

2.1 Outlines
============

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.  Outlines allow a document
to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least for me) is
the best representation of notes and thoughts.  An overview of this
structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the document
to show only the general document structure and the parts currently
being worked on.  Org greatly simplifies the use of outlines by
compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single command,
`org-cycle', which is bound to the <TAB> key.


File: org,  Node: Headlines,  Next: Visibility cycling,  Prev: Outlines,  Up: Document Structure

2.2 Headlines
=============

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in
Org start with one or more stars, on the left margin(1).  For example:

     * Top level headline
     ** Second level
     *** 3rd level
         some text
     *** 3rd level
         more text

     * Another top level headline

Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.
*note Clean view::, describes a setup to realize this.

   An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable `org-cycle-separator-lines' to modify this behavior.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-special-ctrl-a/e' to configure special
behavior of `C-a' and `C-e' in headlines.


File: org,  Node: Visibility cycling,  Next: Motion,  Prev: Headlines,  Up: Document Structure

2.3 Visibility cycling
======================

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.  Org
uses just two commands, bound to <TAB> and `S-<TAB>' to change the
visibility in the buffer.

`<TAB>'
     _Subtree cycling_: Rotate current subtree among the states

          ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
          '-----------------------------------'

     The cursor must be on a headline for this to work(1).  When the
     cursor is at the beginning of the buffer and the first line is not
     a headline, then <TAB> actually runs global cycling (see
     below)(2).  Also when called with a prefix argument (`C-u <TAB>'),
     global cycling is invoked.

`S-<TAB>'
`C-u <TAB>'
     _Global cycling_: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

          ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
          '--------------------------------------'

     When `S-<TAB>' is called with a numeric prefix argument N, the
     CONTENTS view up to headlines of level N will be shown.  Note that
     inside tables, `S-<TAB>' jumps to the previous field.

`C-u C-u C-u <TAB>'
     Show all, including drawers.  

`C-c C-r'
     Reveal context around point, showing the current entry, the
     following heading and the hierarchy above.  Useful for working
     near a location that has been exposed by a sparse tree command
     (*note Sparse trees::) or an agenda command (*note Agenda
     commands::).  With a prefix argument show, on each level, all
     sibling headings.  

`C-c C-x b'
     Show the current subtree in an indirect buffer(3).  With a numeric
     prefix argument N, go up to level N and then take that tree.  If N
     is negative then go up that many levels.  With a `C-u' prefix, do
     not remove the previously used indirect buffer.

   When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e., configured through the variable `org-startup-folded',
or on a per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in
the buffer:

     #+STARTUP: overview
     #+STARTUP: content
     #+STARTUP: showall
     #+STARTUP: showeverything

Furthermore, any entries with a `VISIBILITY' property (*note Properties
and Columns::) will get their visibility adapted accordingly.  Allowed
values for this property are `folded', `children', `content', and `all'.
`C-u C-u <TAB>'
     Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer, i.e.,
     requested by startup options and `VISIBILITY' properties in
     individual entries.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) see, however, the option `org-cycle-emulate-tab'.

   (2) see the option `org-cycle-global-at-bob'.

   (3) The indirect buffer (*note Indirect Buffers: (emacs)Indirect
Buffers.)  will contain the entire buffer, but will be narrowed to the
current tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also change the
original buffer, but without affecting visibility in that buffer.


File: org,  Node: Motion,  Next: Structure editing,  Prev: Visibility cycling,  Up: Document Structure

2.4 Motion
==========

The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

`C-c C-n'
     Next heading.  

`C-c C-p'
     Previous heading.  

`C-c C-f'
     Next heading same level.  

`C-c C-b'
     Previous heading same level.  

`C-c C-u'
     Backward to higher level heading.  

`C-c C-j'
     Jump to a different place without changing the current outline
     visibility.  Shows the document structure in a temporary buffer,
     where you can use the following keys to find your destination: 
          <TAB>         Cycle visibility.
          <down> / <up>   Next/previous visible headline.
          <RET>         Select this location.
          /           Do a Sparse-tree search
          The following keys work if you turn off `org-goto-auto-isearch'
          n / p        Next/previous visible headline.
          f / b        Next/previous headline same level.
          u            One level up.
          0-9          Digit argument.
          q            Quit
     See also the variable `org-goto-interface'.


File: org,  Node: Structure editing,  Next: Archiving,  Prev: Motion,  Up: Document Structure

2.5 Structure editing
=====================

`M-<RET>'
     Insert new heading with same level as current.  If the cursor is
     in a plain list item, a new item is created (*note Plain lists::).
     To force creation of a new headline, use a prefix argument, or
     first press <RET> to get to the beginning of the next line.  When
     this command is used in the middle of a line, the line is split
     and the rest of the line becomes the new headline(1).  If the
     command is used at the beginning of a headline, the new headline is
     created before the current line.  If at the beginning of any other
     line, the content of that line is made the new heading.  If the
     command is used at the end of a folded subtree (i.e., of a
     headline), then a headline like the current one will be inserted
     after the end of the subtree.  

`C-<RET>'
     Just like `M-<RET>', except when adding a new heading below the
     current heading, the new heading is placed after the body instead
     of before it.  This command works from anywhere in the entry.  

`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  See
     also the variable `org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change'.  

`C-S-<RET>'
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  Like
     `C-<RET>', the new headline will be inserted after the current
     subtree.  

`M-<left>'
     Promote current heading by one level.  

`M-<right>'
     Demote current heading by one level.  

`M-S-<left>'
     Promote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<right>'
     Demote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<up>'
     Move subtree up (swap with previous subtree of same level).  

`M-S-<down>'
     Move subtree down (swap with next subtree of same level).  

`C-c C-x C-w'
     Kill subtree, i.e., With a numeric prefix argument N, kill N
     sequential subtrees.  

`C-c C-x M-w'
     Copy subtree to kill ring.  With a numeric prefix argument N, copy
     the N sequential subtrees.  

`C-c C-x C-y'
     Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the
     subtree to make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position.
     The yank level can also be specified with a numeric prefix
     argument, or by yanking after a headline marker like `****'.  

`C-y'
     Depending on the variables `org-yank-adjusted-subtrees' and
     `org-yank-folded-subtrees', Org's internal `yank' command will
     paste subtrees folded and in a clever way, using the same command
     as `C-c C-x C-y'.  With the default settings, no level adjustment
     will take place, but the yanked tree will be folded unless doing
     so would swallow text previously visible.  Any prefix argument to
     this command will force a normal `yank' to be executed, with the
     prefix passed along.  A good way to force a normal yank is `C-u
     C-y'.  If you use `yank-pop' after a yank, it will yank previous
     kill items plainly, without adjustment and folding.  

`C-c C-x c'
     Clone a subtree by making a number of sibling copies of it.  You
     will be prompted for the number of copies to make, and you can
     also specify if any timestamps in the entry should be shifted.
     This can be useful, for example, to create a number of tasks
     related to a series of lectures to prepare.  For more details, see
     the docstring of the command `org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift'.  

`C-c C-w'
     Refile entry or region to a different location.  *Note Refiling
     notes::.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort same-level entries.  When there is an active region, all
     entries in the region will be sorted.  Otherwise the children of
     the current headline are sorted.  The command prompts for the
     sorting method, which can be alphabetically, numerically, by time
     (first timestamp with active preferred, creation time, scheduled
     time, deadline time), by priority, by TODO keyword (in the
     sequence the keywords have been defined in the setup) or by the
     value of a property.  Reverse sorting is possible as well.  You
     can also supply your own function to extract the sorting key.
     With a `C-u' prefix, sorting will be case-sensitive.  With two
     `C-u C-u' prefixes, duplicate entries will also be removed.  

`C-x n s'
     Narrow buffer to current subtree.  

`C-x n w'
     Widen buffer to remove narrowing.  

`C-c *'
     Turn a normal line or plain list item into a headline (so that it
     becomes a subheading at its location).  Also turn a headline into
     a normal line by removing the stars.  If there is an active
     region, turn all lines in the region into headlines.  If the first
     line in the region was an item, turn only the item lines into
     headlines.  Finally, if the first line is a headline, remove the
     stars from all headlines in the region.

   When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of a
line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the line
just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the cursor is
inside a table (*note Tables::), the Meta-Cursor keys have different
functionality.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you do not want the line to be split, customize the variable
`org-M-RET-may-split-line'.

2.6 Archiving
=============

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to
move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Org mode knows two ways of archiving.  You can mark a tree with
the ARCHIVE tag, or you can move an entire (sub)tree to a different
location.

* Menu:

* ARCHIVE tag::                 Marking a tree as inactive
* Moving subtrees::             Moving a tree to an archive file


File: org,  Node: ARCHIVE tag,  Next: Moving subtrees,  Prev: Archiving,  Up: Archiving

2.6.1 The ARCHIVE tag
---------------------

A headline that is marked with the ARCHIVE tag (*note Tags::) stays at
its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following way:
   - It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility
     cycling command (*note Visibility cycling::).  You can force
     cycling archived subtrees with `C-<TAB>', or by setting the option
     `org-cycle-open-archived-trees'.  Also normal outline commands like
     `show-all' will open archived subtrees.

   - During sparse tree construction (*note Sparse trees::), matches in
     archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the option
     `org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees'.

   - During agenda view construction (*note Agenda Views::), the
     content of archived trees is ignored unless you configure the
     option `org-agenda-skip-archived-trees', in which case these trees
     will always be included.  In the agenda you can press the `v' key
     to get archives temporarily included.

   - Archived trees are not exported (*note Exporting::), only the
     headline is.  Configure the details using the variable
     `org-export-with-archived-trees'.

   - Archived trees are excluded from column view unless the variable
     `org-columns-skip-arrchived-trees' is configured to `nil'.

   The following commands help managing the ARCHIVE tag:

`C-c C-x a'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is
     set, the headline changes to a shadowed face, and the subtree
     below it is hidden.  

`C-u C-c C-x a'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline should be
     archived.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO
     entries.  If none are found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE
     tag for the child.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline when this
     command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.  

`C-TAB'
     Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ARCHIVE.


File: org,  Node: Moving subtrees,  Prev: ARCHIVE tag,  Up: Archiving

2.6.2 Moving subtrees
---------------------

Once an entire project is finished, you may want to move it to a
different location.  Org can move it to an _Archive Sibling_ in the
same tree, to a different tree in the current file, or to a different
file, the archive file.

`C-c C-x A'
     Move the current entry to the _Archive Sibling_.  This is a
     sibling of the entry with the heading `Archive' and the tag
     `ARCHIVE' (*note ARCHIVE tag::).  The entry becomes a child of
     that sibling and in this way retains a lot of its original
     context, including inherited tags and approximate position in the
     outline.  

`C-c $'

`C-c C-x C-s'
     Archive the subtree starting at the cursor position to the location
     given by `org-archive-location'.  Context information that could be
     lost, like the file name, the category, inherited tags, and the
     TODO state will be stored as properties in the entry.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-s'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline could be
     moved to the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for
     open TODO entries.  If none are found, the command offers to move
     it to the archive location.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline
     when this command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.

   The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending `_archive' to the
current file name.  For information and examples on how to change this,
see the documentation string of the variable `org-archive-location'.
There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example(1):

     #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::

If you would like to have a special ARCHIVE location for a single entry
or a (sub)tree, give the entry an `:ARCHIVE:' property with the
location as the value (*note Properties and Columns::).

   When a subtree is moved, it receives a number of special properties
that record context information like the file from where the entry
came, its outline path the archiving time etc.  Configure the variable
`org-archive-save-context-info' to adjust the amount of information
added.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: If there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the archive location
for the text below it.  The first such line also applies to any text
before its definition.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple archive locations in
a buffer is using properties.


File: org,  Node: Sparse trees,  Next: Plain lists,  Prev: Archiving,  Up: Document Structure

2.7 Sparse trees
================

An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct _sparse
trees_ for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is
made visible along with the headline structure above it(1).  Just try
it out and you will see immediately how it works.

   Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

`C-c /'
     This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating
     command.  

`C-c / r'
     Occur.  Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all
     matches.  If the match is in a headline, the headline is made
     visible.  If the match is in the body of an entry, headline and
     body are made visible.  In order to provide minimal context, also
     the full hierarchy of headlines above the match is shown, as well
     as the headline following the match.  Each match is also
     highlighted; the highlights disappear when the buffer is changed
     by an editing command(2), or by pressing `C-c C-c'.  When called
     with a `C-u' prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so
     several calls to this command can be stacked.

For frequently used sparse trees of specific search strings, you can
use the variable `org-agenda-custom-commands' to define fast keyboard
access to specific sparse trees.  These commands will then be
accessible through the agenda dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))

will define the key `C-c a f' as a shortcut for creating a sparse tree
matching the string `FIXME'.

   The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO
keywords, tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this
manual.

   To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
`ps-print-buffer-with-faces' which does not print invisible parts of
the document (3).  Or you can use the command `C-c C-e v' to export
only the visible part of the document and print the resulting file.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the variables `org-show-hierarchy-above',
`org-show-following-heading', `org-show-siblings', and
`org-show-entry-below' for detailed control on how much context is
shown around each match.

   (2) This depends on the option `org-remove-highlights-with-change'

   (3) This does not work under XEmacs, because XEmacs uses selective
display for outlining, not text properties.


File: org,  Node: Plain lists,  Next: Drawers,  Prev: Sparse trees,  Up: Document Structure

2.8 Plain lists
===============

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (*note Checkboxes::).  Org supports editing such lists, and
the HTML exporter (*note Exporting::) parses and formats them.

   Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.
   * _Unordered_ list items start with `-', `+', or `*'(1) as bullets.

   * _Ordered_ list items start with a numeral followed by either a
     period or a right parenthesis, such as `1.' or `1)'.

   * _Description_ list items are like unordered list items, but
     contain the separator ` :: ' to separate the description _term_
     from the description.

   Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on
the first line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number
`10.', then the 2-digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the
other numbers in the list.  Indentation also determines the end of a
list item.  It ends before the next line that is indented like the
bullet/number, or less.  Empty lines are part of the previous item, so
you can have several paragraphs in one item.  If you would like an
empty line to terminate all currently open plain lists, configure the
variable `org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists'.  Here is an example:

     ** Lord of the Rings
        My favorite scenes are (in this order)
        1. The attack of the Rohirrim
        2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
           + this was already my favorite scene in the book
           + I really like Miranda Otto.
        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
            - on DVD only
           He makes a really funny face when it happens.
        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
        Important actors in this film are:
        - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
        - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

   Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to
deal with them correctly(2), and by exporting them properly (*note
Exporting::).  Since indentation is what governs the structure of these
lists, many structural constructs like `#+BEGIN_...' blocks can be
indented to signal that they should be part of a list item.

   The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first
line of an item (the line with the bullet or number).

`<TAB>'
     Items can be folded just like headline levels.  Normally this
     works only if the cursor is on a plain list item.  For more
     details, see the variable `org-cycle-include-plain-lists'. to
     `integrate', plain list items will be treated like low-level.  The
     level of an item is then given by the indentation of the
     bullet/number.  Items are always subordinate to real headlines,
     however; the hierarchies remain completely separated.

     If `org-cycle-include-plain-lists' has not been set, <TAB> fixes
     the indentation of the current line in a heuristic way.  

`M-<RET>'
     Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force a
     new heading (*note Structure editing::).  If this command is used
     in the middle of a line, the line is _split_ and the rest of the
     line becomes the new item(3).  If this command is executed in the
     _whitespace before a bullet or number_, the new item is created
     _before_ the current item.  If the command is executed in the white
     space before the text that is part of an item but does not contain
     the bullet, a bullet is added to the current line.  

`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Jump to the previous/next item in the current list, but only if
     `org-support-shift-select' is off.  If not, you can still use
     paragraph jumping commands like `C-<up>' and `C-<down>' to quite
     similar effect.  

`M-S-<up>'
`M-S-<down>'
     Move the item including subitems up/down (swap with previous/next
     item of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering is
     automatic.  

`M-S-<left>'
`M-S-<right>'
     Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
     Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.
     When these commands are executed several times in direct
     succession, the initially selected region is used, even if the new
     indentation would imply a different hierarchy.  To use the new
     hierarchy, break the command chain with a cursor motion or so.  

`C-c C-c'
     If there is a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::) in the item line,
     toggle the state of the checkbox.  If not, this command makes sure
     that all the items on this list level use the same bullet.
     Furthermore, if this is an ordered list, make sure the numbering
     is OK.  

`C-c -'
     Cycle the entire list level through the different
     itemize/enumerate bullets (`-', `+', `*', `1.', `1)').  With a
     numeric prefix argument N, select the Nth bullet from this list.
     If there is an active region when calling this, all lines will be
     converted to list items.  If the first line already was a list
     item, any item markers will be removed from the list.  Finally,
     even without an active region, a normal line will be converted
     into a list item.  

`C-c *'
     Turn a plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a
     subheading at its location). *Note Structure editing::, for a
     detailed explanation.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     This command also cycles bullet styles when the cursor in on the
     bullet or anywhere in an item line, details depending on
     `org-support-shift-select'.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort the plain list.  You will be prompted for the sorting method:
     numerically, alphabetically, by time, or by custom function.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When using `*' as a bullet, lines must be indented or they will
be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a
star are visually indistinguishable from true headlines.  In short:
even though `*' is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain
list items.

   (2) Org only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For XEmacs,
you should use Kyle E. Jones' `filladapt.el'.  To turn this on, put
into `.emacs': `(require 'filladapt)'

   (3) If you do not want the line to be split, customize the variable
`org-M-RET-may-split-line'.

2.9 Drawers
===========

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org mode has _drawers_.
Drawers need to be configured with the variable `org-drawers'(1).
Drawers look like this:

     ** This is a headline
        Still outside the drawer
        :DRAWERNAME:
           This is inside the drawer.
        :END:
        After the drawer.

   Visibility cycling (*note Visibility cycling::) on the headline will
hide and show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single
line.  In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move the cursor
to the drawer line and press <TAB> there.  Org mode uses the
`PROPERTIES' drawer for storing properties (*note Properties and
Columns::), and you can also arrange for state change notes (*note
Tracking TODO state changes::) and clock times (*note Clocking work
time::) to be stored in a drawer `LOGBOOK'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can define drawers on a per-file basis with a line like
`#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN PROPERTIES STATE'

2.10 Blocks
===========

Org-mode uses begin...end blocks for various purposes from including
source code examples (*note Literal examples::) to capturing time
logging information (*note Clocking work time::).  These blocks can be
folded and unfolded by pressing TAB in the begin line.  You can also
get all blocks folded at startup by configuring the variable
`org-hide-block-startup' or on a per-file basis by using

     #+STARTUP: hideblocks
     #+STARTUP: nohideblocks

2.11 Footnotes
==============

Org mode supports the creation of footnotes.  In contrast to the
`footnote.el' package, Org mode's footnotes are designed for work on a
larger document, not only for one-off documents like emails.  The basic
syntax is similar to the one used by `footnote.el', i.e., defined in a
paragraph that is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in
column 0, no indentation allowed.  If you need a paragraph break inside
a footnote, use the LaTeX idiom `\par'.  The footnote reference is
simply the marker in square brackets, inside text.  For example:

     The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
     ...
     [fn:1] The link is: http://orgmode.org

   Org mode extends the number-based syntax to _named_ footnotes and
optional inline definition.  Using plain numbers as markers (as
`footnote.el' does) is supported for backward compatibility, but not
encouraged because of possible conflicts with LaTeX snippets (*note
Embedded LaTeX::).  Here are the valid references:

`[1]'
     A plain numeric footnote marker.  Compatible with `footnote.el',
     but not recommended because somthing like `[1]' could easily be
     part of a code snippet.

`[fn:name]'
     A named footnote reference, where `name' is a unique label word,
     or, for simplicity of automatic creation, a number.

`[fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]'
     A LaTeX-like anonymous footnote where the definition is given
     directly at the reference point.

`[fn:name: a definition]'
     An inline definition of a footnote, which also specifies a name
     for the note.  Since Org allows multiple references to the same
     note, you can then use `[fn:name]' to create additional references.

   Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you can create
names yourself.  This is handled by the variable
`org-footnote-auto-label' and its corresponding `#+STARTUP' keywords,
see the docstring of that variable for details.

The following command handles footnotes:

`C-c C-x f'
     The footnote action command.

     When the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the
     definition.  When it is at a definition, jump to the (first)
     reference.

     Otherwise, create a new footnote.  Depending on the variable
     `org-footnote-define-inline'(1), the definition will be placed
     right into the text as part of the reference, or separately into
     the location determined by the variable `org-footnote-section'.

     When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu of
     additional options is offered:
          s   Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.  During editing,
              Org makes no effort to sort footnote definitions into a particular
              sequence.  If you want them sorted, use this command, which will
              also move entries according to `org-footnote-section'.  Automatic
              sorting after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the
              variable `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.
          r   Renumber the simple `fn:N' footnotes.  Automatic renumbering
              after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the variable
              `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.
          S   Short for first `r', then `s' action.
          n   Normalize the footnotes by collecting all definitions (including
              inline definitions) into a special section, and then numbering them
              in sequence.  The references will then also be numbers.  This is
              meant to be the final step before finishing a document (e.g. sending
              off an email).  The exporters do this automatically, and so could
              something like `message-send-hook'.
          d   Delete the footnote at point, and all definitions of and references
              to it.
     Depending on the variable `org-footnote-auto-adjust'(2),
     renumbering and sorting footnotes can be automatic after each
     insertion or deletion.

`C-c C-c'
     If the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.
     If it is a the definition, jump back to the reference.  When
     called at a footnote location with a prefix argument, offer the
     same menu as `C-c C-x f'.  

`C-c C-o  or mouse-1/2'
     Footnote labels are also links to the corresponding
     definition/reference, and you can use the usual commands to follow
     these links.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: fninline' or
`#+STARTUP: nofninline'

   (2) the corresponding in-buffer options are `fnadjust' and
`nofnadjust'.

2.12 The Orgstruct minor mode
=============================

If you like the intuitive way the Org mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes
like Text mode or Mail mode as well.  The minor mode `orgstruct-mode'
makes this possible.   Toggle the mode with `M-x orgstruct-mode', or
turn it on by default, for example in Mail mode, with one of:

     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)
     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct++)

   When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to
Org like a headline or the first line of a list item, most structure
editing commands will work, even if the same keys normally have
different functionality in the major mode you are using.  If the cursor
is not in one of those special lines, Orgstruct mode lurks silently in
the shadow.  When you use `orgstruct++-mode', Org will also export
indentation and autofill settings into that mode, and detect item
context after the first line of an item.

File: org,  Node: Built-in table editor,  Next: Column width and alignment,  Prev: Tables,  Up: Tables

3.1 The built-in table editor
=============================

Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with `|'
as the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a table.
`|' is also the column separator.  A table might look like this:

     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     |-------+-------+-----|
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press <TAB> or
<RET> or `C-c C-c' inside the table.  <TAB> also moves to the next
field (<RET> to the next row) and creates new table rows at the end of
the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is
set by the first line.  Any line starting with `|-' is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width.  So, to create the above table, you would
only type

     |Name|Phone|Age|
     |-

and then press <TAB> to align the table and start filling in fields.
Even faster would be to type `|Name|Phone|Age' followed by `C-c <RET>'.

   When typing text into a field, Org treats <DEL>, <Backspace>, and
all character keys in a special way, so that inserting and deleting
avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when typing _immediately after the
cursor was moved into a new field with `<TAB>', `S-<TAB>' or `<RET>'_,
the field is automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too
unpredictable for you, configure the variables
`org-enable-table-editor' and `org-table-auto-blank-field'.

Creation and conversion
.......................

`C-c |'
     Convert the active region to table. If every line contains at
     least one TAB character, the function assumes that the material is
     tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.  You can use a prefix argument to force a specific
     separator: `C-u' forces CSV, `C-u C-u' forces TAB, and a numeric
     argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces, or
     alternatively a TAB will be the separator.
     If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org
     table.  But it's easier just to start typing, like
     `|Name|Phone|Age <RET> |- <TAB>'.

Re-aligning and field motion
............................

`C-c C-c'
     Re-align the table without moving the cursor.  

`<TAB>'
     Re-align the table, move to the next field.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  

`S-<TAB>'
     Re-align, move to previous field.  

`<RET>'
     Re-align the table and move down to next row.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  At the beginning or end of a line, <RET> still does
     NEWLINE, so it can be used to split a table.  

`M-a'
     Move to beginning of the current table field, or on to the
     previous field.  

`M-e'
     Move to end of the current table field, or on to the next field.

Column and row editing
......................

`M-<left>'
`M-<right>'
     Move the current column left/right.  

`M-S-<left>'
     Kill the current column.  

`M-S-<right>'
     Insert a new column to the left of the cursor position.  

`M-<up>'
`M-<down>'
     Move the current row up/down.  

`M-S-<up>'
     Kill the current row or horizontal line.  

`M-S-<down>'
     Insert a new row above the current row.  With a prefix argument,
     the line is created below the current one.  

`C-c -'
     Insert a horizontal line below current row.  With a prefix
     argument, the line is created above the current line.  

`C-c <RET>'
     Insert a horizontal line below current row, and move the cursor
     into the row below that line.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point
     indicates the column to be used for sorting, and the range of
     lines is the range between the nearest horizontal separator lines,
     or the entire table.  If point is before the first column, you
     will be prompted for the sorting column.  If there is an active
     region, the mark specifies the first line and the sorting column,
     while point should be in the last line to be included into the
     sorting.  The command prompts for the sorting type
     (alphabetically, numerically, or by time).  When called with a
     prefix argument, alphabetic sorting will be case-sensitive.

Regions
.......

`C-c C-x M-w'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard.
     Point and mark determine edge fields of the rectangle.  If there
     is no active region, copy just the current field.  The process
     ignores horizontal separator lines.  

`C-c C-x C-w'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard, and
     blank all fields in the rectangle.  So this is the "cut" operation.  

`C-c C-x C-y'
     Paste a rectangular region into a table.  The upper left corner
     ends up in the current field.  All involved fields will be
     overwritten.  If the rectangle does not fit into the present table,
     the table is enlarged as needed.  The process ignores horizontal
     separator lines.  

`M-RET'
     Wrap several fields in a column like a paragraph.  If there is an
     active region, and both point and mark are in the same column, the
     text in the column is wrapped to minimum width for the given
     number of lines.  A numeric prefix argument may be used to change
     the number of desired lines.  If there is no region, the current
     field is split at the cursor position and the text fragment to the
     right of the cursor is prepended to the field one line down. If
     there is no region, but you specify a prefix argument, the current
     field is made blank, and the content is appended to the field
     above.

Calculations
............

`C-c +'
     Sum the numbers in the current column, or in the rectangle defined
     by the active region.  The result is shown in the echo area and can
     be inserted with `C-y'.  

`S-<RET>'
     When current field is empty, copy from first non-empty field
     above.  When not empty, copy current field down to next row and
     move cursor along with it.  Depending on the variable
     `org-table-copy-increment', integer field values will be
     incremented during copy.  Integers that are too large will not be
     incremented.  Also, a `0' prefix argument temporarily disables the
     increment.  This key is also used by shift-selection and related
     modes (*note Conflicts::).

Miscellaneous
.............

`C-c `'
     Edit the current field in a separate window.  This is useful for
     fields that are not fully visible (*note Column width and
     alignment::).  When called with a `C-u' prefix, just make the full
     field visible, so that it can be edited in place.

`M-x org-table-import'
     Import a file as a table.  The table should be TAB or whitespace
     separated.  Use, for example, to import a spreadsheet table or data
     from a database, because these programs generally can write
     TAB-separated text files.  This command works by inserting the
     file into the buffer and then converting the region to a table.
     Any prefix argument is passed on to the converter, which uses it
     to determine the separator.

`C-c |'
     Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the Org
     buffer, selecting the pasted text with `C-x C-x' and then using the
     `C-c |' command (see above under Creation and conversion).

`M-x org-table-export'
     Export the table, by default as a TAB-separated file.  Use for data
     exchange with, for example, spreadsheet or database programs.  The
     format used to export the file can be configured in the variable
     `org-table-export-default-format'.  You may also use properties
     `TABLE_EXPORT_FILE' and `TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT' to specify the file
     name and the format for table export in a subtree.  Org supports
     quite general formats for exported tables.  The exporter format is
     the same as the format used by Orgtbl radio tables, see *note
     Translator functions::, for a detailed description.

   If you don't like the automatic table editor because it gets in your
way on lines which you would like to start with `|', you can turn it
off with

     (setq org-enable-table-editor nil)

Then the only table command that still works is `C-c C-c' to do a
manual re-align.


File: org,  Node: Column width and alignment,  Next: Column groups,  Prev: Built-in table editor,  Up: Tables

3.2 Column width and alignment
==============================

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.
And also the alignment of a column is determined automatically from the
fraction of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

   Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text,
leading to inconveniently wide columns.  To limit(1) the width of a
column, one field anywhere in the column may contain just the string
`<N>' where `N' is an integer specifying the width of the column in
characters.  The next re-align will then set the width of this column
to no more than this value.

     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
     |   |                              |               |   | <6>    |
     | 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
     | 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
     | 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=> |
     | 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|

Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string `=>'.  Note
that the full text is still in the buffer, it is only invisible.  To
see the full text, hold the mouse over the field--a tool-tip window
will show the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command `C-c
`' (that is `C-c' followed by the backquote).  This will open a new
window with the full field.  Edit it and finish with `C-c C-c'.

   When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
`org-startup-align-all-tables' will realign all tables in a file upon
visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option on
a per-file basis with:

     #+STARTUP: align
     #+STARTUP: noalign

   If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich
columns to the right and of string-rich column to the left, you and use
`<r>' or `<l>' in a similar fashion.  You may also combine alignment
and field width like this: `<l10>'.

3.3 Column groups
=================

When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical lines
because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only `/'.  The further fields can either contain
`<' to indicate that this column should start a group, `>' to indicate
the end of a column, or `<>' to make a column a group of its own.
Boundaries between column groups will upon export be marked with
vertical lines.  Here is an example:

     |   |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | / | <> |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |

3.4 The Orgtbl minor mode
=========================

If you like the intuitive way the Org table editor works, you might
also want to use it in other modes like Text mode or Mail mode.  The
minor mode Orgtbl mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle the
mode with `M-x orgtbl-mode'.  To turn it on by default, for example in
mail mode, use

     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)

   Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain
tables in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl mode.  For example, it is
possible to construct LaTeX tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see
*note Tables in arbitrary syntax::.

3.5 The spreadsheet
===================

The table editor makes use of the Emacs `calc' package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org's
implementation is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example,
Org knows the concept of a _column formula_ that will be applied to all
non-header fields in a column without having to copy the formula to
each relevant field.

3.5.1 References
----------------

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org, fields can be referenced by
name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press `C-c ?' in that field,
or press `C-c }' to toggle the display of a grid.

Field references
................

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like `B3', meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd row.

Org also uses another, more general operator that looks like this:
     @ROW$COLUMN

Column references can be absolute like `1', `2',...`N', or relative to
the current column like `+1' or `-2'.

   The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines (hlines).  You can use absolute row numbers `1'...`N',
and row numbers relative to the current row like `+3' or `-1'.  Or
specify the row relative to one of the hlines: `I' refers to the first
hline(1), `II' to the second, etc.  `-I' refers to the first such line
above the current line, `+I' to the first such line below the current
line.  You can also write `III+2' which is the second data line after
the third hline in the table.

   `0' refers to the current row and column.  Also, if you omit either
the column or the row part of the reference, the current row/column is
implied.

   Org's references with _unsigned_ numbers are fixed references in the
sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.  Org's
references with _signed_ numbers are floating references because the
same reference operator can reference different fields depending on the
field being calculated by the formula.

   As a special case, references like `$LR5' and `$LR12' can be used to
refer in a stable way to the 5th and 12th field in the last row of the
table.

   Here are a few examples:

     @2$3      2nd row, 3rd column
     C2        same as previous
     $5        column 5 in the current row
     E&        same as previous
     @2        current column, row 2
     @-1$-3    the field one row up, three columns to the left
     @-I$2     field just under hline above current row, column 2

Range references
................

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots `..'.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use `$2..$7', but if at least one field is
in a different row, you need to use the general `@row$column' format at
least for the first field (i.e the reference must start with `@' in
order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

     $1..$3        First three fields in the current row.
     $P..$Q        Range, using column names (see under Advanced)
     @2$1..@4$3    6 fields between these two fields.
     A2..C4        Same as above.
     @-1$-2..@-1   3 numbers from the column to the left, 2 up to current row

Range references return a vector of values that can be fed into Calc
vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally suppressed, so
that the vector contains only the non-empty fields (but see the `E'
mode switch below).  If there are no non-empty fields, `[0]' is
returned to avoid syntax errors in formulas.

Named references
................

`$name' is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or constant.
Constants are defined globally through the variable
`org-table-formula-constants', and locally (for the file) through a
line like

     #+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6

Also properties (*note Properties and Columns::) can be used as
constants in table formulas: for a property `:Xyz:' use the name
`$PROP_Xyz', and the property will be searched in the current outline
entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the `constants.el'
package, it will also be used to resolve constants, including natural
constants like `$h' for Planck's constant, and units like `$km' for
kilometers(2).  Column names and parameters can be specified in special
table lines.  These are described below, see *note Advanced features::.
All names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

Remote references
.................

You may also reference constants, fields and ranges from a different
table, either in the current file or even in a different file.  The
syntax is

     remote(NAME-OR-ID,REF)

where NAME can be the name of a table in the current file as set by a
`#+TBLNAME: NAME' line before the table.  It can also be the ID of an
entry, even in a different file, and the reference then refers to the
first table in that entry.  REF is an absolute field or range reference
as described above for example `@3$3' or `$somename', valid in the
referenced table.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that only hlines are counted that _separate_ table lines.
If the table starts with a hline above the header, it does not count.

   (2) `constants.el' can supply the values of constants in two
different unit systems, `SI' and `cgs'.  Which one is used depends on
the value of the variable `constants-unit-system'.  You can use the
`#+STARTUP' options `constSI' and `constcgs' to set this value for the
current buffer.

3.5.2 Formula syntax for Calc
-----------------------------

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs
`Calc' package.  Note that `calc' has the non-standard convention that
`/' has lower precedence than `*', so that `a/b*c' is interpreted as
`a/(b*c)'.  Before evaluation by `calc-eval' (*note calc-eval:
(Calc)Calling Calc from Your Programs.), variable substitution takes
place according to the rules described above.  The range vectors can be
directly fed into the Calc vector functions like `vmean' and `vsum'.

   A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.
This string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org uses the standard Calc modes (precision 12,
angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off).  The display
format, however, has been changed to `(float 8)' to keep tables
compact.  The default settings can be configured using the variable
`org-calc-default-modes'.

     p20           switch the internal precision to 20 digits
     n3 s3 e2 f4   normal, scientific, engineering, or fixed display format
     D R           angle modes: degrees, radians
     F S           fraction and symbolic modes
     N             interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers
     T             force text interpretation
     E             keep empty fields in ranges
     L             literal

In addition, you may provide a `printf' format specifier to reformat
the final result.  A few examples:

     $1+$2                Sum of first and second field
     $1+$2;%.2f           Same, format result to two decimals
     exp($2)+exp($1)      Math functions can be used
     $0;%.1f              Reformat current cell to 1 decimal
     ($3-32)*5/9          Degrees F -> C conversion
     $c/$1/$cm            Hz -> cm conversion, using `constants.el'
     tan($1);Dp3s1        Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1
     sin($1);Dp3%.1e      Same, but use printf specifier for display
     vmean($2..$7)        Compute column range mean, using vector function
     vmean($2..$7);EN     Same, but treat empty fields as 0
     taylor($3,x=7,2)     taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree

   Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations.  For example

     if($1<20,teen,string(""))  "teen" if age $1 less than 20, else empty


File: org,  Node: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Next: Field formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Calc,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.3 Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
----------------------------------

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp; this can be useful
for string manipulation and control structures, if Calc's functionality
is not enough.  If a formula starts with a single-quote followed by an
opening parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a Lisp form.  The
evaluation should return either a string or a number.  Just as with
`calc' formulas, you can specify modes and a printf format after a
semicolon.  With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be conscious about the
way field references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a
reference will be interpolated as a Lisp string (in double-quotes)
containing the field.  If you provide the `N' mode switch, all
referenced elements will be numbers (non-number fields will be zero) and
interpolated as Lisp numbers, without quotes.  If you provide the `L'
flag, all fields will be interpolated literally, without quotes.
I.e.,, if you want a reference to be interpreted as a string by the Lisp
form, enclose the reference operator itself in double-quotes, like
`"$3"'.  Ranges are inserted as space-separated fields, so you can
embed them in list or vector syntax.  A few examples, note how the `N'
mode is used when we do computations in Lisp.

     Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1
       '(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))
     Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to Calc's `$1+$2'
       '(+ $1 $2);N
     Compute the sum of columns 1-4, like Calc's `vsum($1..$4)'
       '(apply '+ '($1..$4));N


File: org,  Node: Field formulas,  Next: Column formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.4 Field formulas
--------------------

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by `:=', for example `:=$1+$2'.  When you press <TAB>
or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the formula
will be stored as the formula for this field, evaluated, and the
current field replaced with the result.

   Formulas are stored in a special line starting with `#+TBLFM:'
directly below the table.  If you typed the equation in the 4th field of
the 3rd data line in the table, the formula will look like
`@3$4=$1+$2'.  When inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with
the appropriate commands, absolute references (but not relative ones)
in stored formulas are modified in order to still reference the same
field.  Of course this is not true if you edit the table structure with
normal editing commands--then you must fix the equations yourself.  The
left-hand side of a formula may also be a named field (*note Advanced
features::), or a last-row reference like `$LR3'.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command

`C-u C-c ='
     Install a new formula for the current field.  The command prompts
     for a formula with default taken from the `#+TBLFM:' line, applies
     it to the current field, and stores it.


File: org,  Node: Column formulas,  Next: Editing and debugging formulas,  Prev: Field formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.5 Column formulas
---------------------

Often in a table, the same formula should be used for all fields in a
particular column.  Instead of having to copy the formula to all fields
in that column, Org allows you to assign a single formula to an entire
column.  If the table contains horizontal separator hlines, everything
before the first such line is considered part of the table _header_ and
will not be modified by column formulas.

   To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in
the column, preceded by an equal sign, like `=$1+$2'.  When you press
<TAB> or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the
formula will be stored as the formula for the current column, evaluated
and the current field replaced with the result.  If the field contains
only `=', the previously stored formula for this column is used.  For
each column, Org will only remember the most recently used formula.  In
the `#+TBLFM:' line, column formulas will look like `$4=$1+$2'.  The
left-hand side of a column formula cannot currently be the name of
column, it must be the numeric column reference.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

`C-c ='
     Install a new formula for the current column and replace current
     field with the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a
     formula, with default taken from the `#+TBLFM' line, applies it to
     the current field and stores it.  With a numeric prefix
     argument(e.g., will apply it to that many consecutive fields in
     the current column.


File: org,  Node: Editing and debugging formulas,  Next: Updating the table,  Prev: Column formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.6 Editing and debugging formulas
------------------------------------

You can edit individual formulas in the minibuffer or directly in the
field.  Org can also prepare a special buffer with all active formulas
of a table.  When offering a formula for editing, Org converts
references to the standard format (like `B3' or `D&') if possible.  If
you prefer to only work with the internal format (like `@3$2' or `$4'),
configure the variable `org-table-use-standard-references'.

`C-c ='
`C-u C-c ='
     Edit the formula associated with the current column/field in the
     minibuffer.  See *note Column formulas::, and *note Field
     formulas::.  

`C-u C-u C-c ='
     Re-insert the active formula (either a field formula, or a column
     formula) into the current field, so that you can edit it directly
     in the field.  The advantage over editing in the minibuffer is
     that you can use the command `C-c ?'.  

`C-c ?'
     While editing a formula in a table field, highlight the field(s)
     referenced by the reference at the cursor position in the formula.  

`C-c }'
     Toggle the display of row and column numbers for a table, using
     overlays.  These are updated each time the table is aligned; you
     can force it with `C-c C-c'.  

`C-c {'
     Toggle the formula debugger on and off.  See below.  

`C-c ''
     Edit all formulas for the current table in a special buffer, where
     the formulas will be displayed one per line.  If the current field
     has an active formula, the cursor in the formula editor will mark
     it.  While inside the special buffer, Org will automatically
     highlight any field or range reference at the cursor position.
     You may edit, remove and add formulas, and use the following
     commands:
    `C-c C-c'
    `C-x C-s'
          Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.
          With `C-u' prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire
          table.  

    `C-c C-q'
          Exit the formula editor without installing changes.  

    `C-c C-r'
          Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard
          (like `B3') and internal (like `@3$2').  

    `<TAB>'
          Pretty-print or indent Lisp formula at point.  When in a line
          containing a Lisp formula, format the formula according to
          Emacs Lisp rules.  Another <TAB> collapses the formula back
          again.  In the open formula, <TAB> re-indents just like in
          Emacs Lisp mode.  

    `M-<TAB>'
          Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs Lisp mode.  

    `S-<up>/<down>/<left>/<right>'
          Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference
          is `B3' and you press `S-<right>', it will become `C3'.  This
          also works for relative references and for hline references.  

    `M-S-<up>/<down>'
          Move the test line for column formulas in the Org buffer up
          and down.  

    `M-<up>/<down>'
          Scroll the window displaying the table.  

    `C-c }'
          Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.

   Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated
with the field, because that is stored in a different line (the
`#+TBLFM' line)--during the next recalculation the field will be filled
again.  To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty
reply when prompted for the formula, or to edit the `#+TBLFM' line.

   You may edit the `#+TBLFM' directly and re-apply the changed
equations with `C-c C-c' in that line or with the normal recalculation
commands in the table.

Debugging formulas
..................

When the evaluation of a formula leads to an error, the field content
becomes the string `#ERROR'.  If you would like see what is going on
during variable substitution and calculation in order to find a bug,
turn on formula debugging in the `Tbl' menu and repeat the calculation,
for example by pressing `C-u C-u C-c = <RET>' in a field.  Detailed
information will be displayed.


File: org,  Node: Updating the table,  Next: Advanced features,  Prev: Editing and debugging formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.7 Updating the table
------------------------

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See *note Advanced features::, for a way to
make recalculation at least semi-automatic.

   In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use
the following commands:

`C-c *'
     Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column
     formulas from left to right, and all field formulas in the current
     row.  

`C-u C-c *'
`C-u C-c C-c'
     Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the
     first hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the
     table header.  

`C-u C-u C-c *'
`C-u C-u C-c C-c'
     Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
     This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of
     other fields that are computed later in the calculation sequence.


File: org,  Node: Advanced features,  Prev: Updating the table,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.8 Advanced features
-----------------------

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if
you want to be able to assign names to fields and columns, you need to
reserve the first column of the table for special marking characters.
`C-#'
     Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states `',
     `#', `*', `!', `$'.  When there is an active region, change all
     marks in the region.

   Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students
and makes use of these features:

     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Student | Prob 1 | Prob 2 | Prob 3 | Total | Note |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | ! |         |     P1 |     P2 |     P3 |   Tot |      |
     | # | Maximum |     10 |     15 |     25 |    50 | 10.0 |
     | ^ |         |     m1 |     m2 |     m3 |    mt |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | # | Peter   |     10 |      8 |     23 |    41 |  8.2 |
     | # | Sam     |      2 |      4 |      3 |     9 |  1.8 |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Average |        |        |        |  29.7 |      |
     | ^ |         |        |        |        |    at |      |
     | $ | max=50  |        |        |        |       |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     #+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@-II..@-I);%.1f

Important: please note that for these special tables, recalculating the
table with `C-u C-c *' will only affect rows that are marked `#' or
`*', and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself.  The
column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

   The marking characters have the following meaning:
`!'
     The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you
     may refer to a column as `$Tot' instead of `$6'.

`^'
     This row defines names for the fields _above_ the row.  With such
     a definition, any formula in the table may use `$m1' to refer to
     the value `10'.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it
     will be stored as `$name=...'.

`_'
     Similar to `^', but defines names for the fields in the row
     _below_.

`$'
     Fields in this row can define _parameters_ for formulas.  For
     example, if a field in a `$' row contains `max=50', then formulas
     in this table can refer to the value 50 using `$max'.  Parameters
     work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on a
     per-table basis.

`#'
     Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
     <TAB> or <RET> or `S-<TAB>' in this row.  Also, this row is
     selected for a global recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.  Unmarked
     lines will be left alone by this command.

`*'
     Selects this line for global recalculation with `C-u C-c *', but
     not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
     recalculation slows down editing too much.

`'
     Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.
     All lines that should be recalculated should be marked with `#' or
     `*'.

`/'
     Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the
     narrowing `<N>' markers or column group markers.

   Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the
fantastic `calc.el' package, here is a table that computes the Taylor
series of degree `n' at location `x' for a couple of functions.

     |---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|

3.6 Org-Plot
============

Org-Plot can produce 2D and 3D graphs of information stored in org
tables using `Gnuplot' `http://www.gnuplot.info/' and `gnuplot-mode'
`http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode.html'.  To see
this in action, ensure that you have both Gnuplot and Gnuplot mode
installed on your system, then call `org-plot/gnuplot' on the following
table.

     #+PLOT: title:"Citas" ind:1 deps:(3) type:2d with:histograms set:"yrange [0:]"
     | Sede      | Max cites | H-index |
     |-----------+-----------+---------|
     | Chile     |    257.72 |   21.39 |
     | Leeds     |    165.77 |   19.68 |
     | Sao Paolo |     71.00 |   11.50 |
     | Stockholm |    134.19 |   14.33 |
     | Morelia   |    257.56 |   17.67 |

   Notice that Org Plot is smart enough to apply the table's headers as
labels.  Further control over the labels, type, content, and appearance
of plots can be exercised through the `#+PLOT:' lines preceding a
table.  See below for a complete list of Org-plot options.  For more
information and examples see the Org-plot tutorial at
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.php'.

Plot Options
............

`set'
     Specify any `gnuplot' option to be set when graphing.

`title'
     Specify the title of the plot.

`ind'
     Specify which column of the table to use as the `x' axis.

`deps'
     Specify the columns to graph as a Lisp style list, surrounded by
     parentheses and separated by spaces for example `dep:(3 4)' to
     graph the third and fourth columns (defaults to graphing all other
     columns aside from the `ind' column).

`type'
     Specify whether the plot will be `2d', `3d', or `grid'.

`with'
     Specify a `with' option to be inserted for every col being plotted
     (e.g., Defaults to `lines'.

`file'
     If you want to plot to a file, specify
     `"PATH/TO/DESIRED/OUTPUT-FILE"'.

`labels'
     List of labels to be used for the deps (defaults to the column
     headers if they exist).

`line'
     Specify an entire line to be inserted in the Gnuplot script.

`map'
     When plotting `3d' or `grid' types, set this to `t' to graph a
     flat mapping rather than a `3d' slope.

`timefmt'
     Specify format of Org-mode timestamps as they will be parsed by
     Gnuplot.  Defaults to `%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S'.

`script'
     If you want total control, you can specify a script file (place
     the file name between double-quotes) which will be used to plot.
     Before plotting, every instance of `$datafile' in the specified
     script will be replaced with the path to the generated data file.
     Note: even if you set this option, you may still want to specify
     the plot type, as that can impact the content of the data file.

File: org,  Node: Link format,  Next: Internal links,  Prev: Hyperlinks,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.1 Link format
===============

Org will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as clickable
links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

     [[link][description]]       or alternatively           [[link]]

Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets present), Org will
change the display so that `description' is displayed instead of
`[[link][description]]' and `link' is displayed instead of `[[link]]'.
Links will be highlighted in the face `org-link', which by default is
an underlined face.  You can directly edit the visible part of a link.
Note that this can be either the `link' part (if there is no
description) or the `description' part.  To edit also the invisible
`link' part, use `C-c C-l' with the cursor on the link.

   If you place the cursor at the beginning or just behind the end of
the displayed text and press <BACKSPACE>, you will remove the
(invisible) bracket at that location.  This makes the link incomplete
and the internals are again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the
missing bracket hides the link internals again.  To show the internal
structure of all links, use the menu entry `Org->Hyperlinks->Literal
links'.


File: org,  Node: Internal links,  Next: External links,  Prev: Link format,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.2 Internal links
==================

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal
in the current file.  The most important case is a link like
`[[#my-custom-id]]' which will link to the entry with the `CUSTOM_ID'
property `my-custom-id'.  Such custom IDs are very good for HTML export
(*note HTML export::) where they produce pretty section links.  You are
responsible yourself to make sure these custom IDs are unique in a file.

   Links such as `[[My Target]]' or `[[My Target][Find my target]]'
lead to a text search in the current file.

   The link can be followed with `C-c C-o' when the cursor is on the
link, or with a mouse click (*note Handling links::).  Links to custom
IDs will point to the corresponding headline.  The preferred match for
a text link is a dedicated target: the same string in double angular
brackets.  Targets may be located anywhere; sometimes it is convenient
to put them into a comment line. For example

     # <<My Target>>

In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such targets will become named
anchors for direct access through `http' links(1).

   If no dedicated target exists, Org will search for the words in the
link.  In the above example the search would be for `my target'.  Links
starting with a star like `*My Target' restrict the search to
headlines(2).  When searching, Org mode will first try an exact match,
but then move on to more and more lenient searches.  For example, the
link `[[*My Targets]]' will find any of the following:

     ** My targets
     ** TODO my targets are bright
     ** my 20 targets are

   Following a link pushes a mark onto Org's own mark ring.  You can
return to the previous position with `C-c &'.  Using this command
several times in direct succession goes back to positions recorded
earlier.

* Menu:

* Radio targets::               Make targets trigger links in plain text

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that text before the first headline is usually not
exported, so the first such target should be after the first headline,
or in the line directly before the first headline.

   (2) To insert a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion can
be used.  Just type a star followed by a few optional letters into the
buffer and press `M-<TAB>'.  All headlines in the current buffer will
be offered as completions.  *Note Handling links::, for more commands
creating links.


File: org,  Node: Radio targets,  Prev: Internal links,  Up: Internal links

4.2.1 Radio targets
-------------------

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names in
normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target `<<<My
Target>>>' causes each occurrence of `my target' in normal text to
become activated as a link.  The Org file is scanned automatically for
radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.  To update
the target list during editing, press `C-c C-c' with the cursor on or
at a target.

4.3 External links
==================

Org supports links to files, websites, Usenet and email messages, BBDB
database entries and links to both IRC conversations and their logs.
External links are URL-like locators.  They start with a short
identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be no space after
the colon.  The following list shows examples for each link type.

     elisp:(find-file-other-frame "Elisp.org") Elisp form to evaluate

   A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a
descriptive text to be displayed instead of the URL (*note Link
format::), for example:

     [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]

If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML
export (*note HTML export::) will inline the image as a clickable
button.  If there is no description at all and the link points to an
image, that image will be inlined into the exported HTML file.

   Org also finds external links in the normal text and activates them
as links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
`bbdb:Richard Stallman'), or if you need to remove ambiguities about
the end of the link, enclose them in square brackets.

4.4 Handling links
==================

Org provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to insert
it into an Org file, and to follow the link.

`C-c l'
     Store a link to the current location.  This is a _global_ command
     (you must create the key binding yourself) which can be used in
     any buffer to create a link.  The link will be stored for later
     insertion into an Org buffer (see below).  What kind of link will
     be created depends on the current buffer:

     Org-mode buffers
     For Org files, if there is a `<<target>>' at the cursor, the link
     points to the target.  Otherwise it points to the current
     headline, which will also be the description.

     If the headline has a `CUSTOM_ID' property, a link to this custom
     ID will be stored.  In addition or alternatively (depending on the
     value of `org-link-to-org-use-id'), a globally unique `ID'
     property will be created and/or used to construct a link.  So
     using this command in Org buffers will potentially create two
     links: a human-readable from the custom ID, and one that is
     globally unique and works even if the entry is moved from file to
     file.  Later, when inserting the link, you need to decide which one
     to use.

     Email/News clients: VM, Rmail, Wanderlust, MH-E, Gnus
     Pretty much all Emacs mail clients are supported.  The link will
     point to the current article, or, in some GNUS buffers, to the
     group.  The description is constructed from the author and the
     subject.

     Web browsers: W3 and W3M
     Here the link will be the current URL, with the page title as
     description.

     Contacts: BBDB
     Links created in a BBDB buffer will point to the current entry.

     Chat: IRC
     For IRC links, if you set the variable `org-irc-link-to-logs' to
     `t', a `file:/' style link to the relevant point in the logs for
     the current conversation is created.  Otherwise an `irc:/' style
     link to the user/channel/server under the point will be stored.

     Other files
     For any other files, the link will point to the file, with a
     search string (*note Search options::) pointing to the contents of
     the current line.  If there is an active region, the selected
     words will form the basis of the search string.  If the
     automatically created link is not working correctly or accurately
     enough, you can write custom functions to select the search string
     and to do the search for particular file types--see *note Custom
     searches::.  The key binding `C-c l' is only a suggestion--see
     *note Installation::.

     Agenda view
     When the cursor is in an agenda view, the created link points to
     the entry referenced by the current line.

`C-c C-l'
     Insert a link(1).  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the
     buffer.  You can just type a link, using text for an internal
     link, or one of the link type prefixes mentioned in the examples
     above.  The link will be inserted into the buffer(2), along with a
     descriptive text.  If some text was selected when this command is
     called, the selected text becomes the default description.

     Inserting stored links
     All links stored during the current session are part of the
     history for this prompt, so you can access them with <up> and
     <down> (or `M-p/n').

     Completion support
     Completion with <TAB> will help you to insert valid link prefixes
     like `http:' or `ftp:', including the prefixes defined through
     link abbreviations (*note Link abbreviations::).  If you press
     <RET> after inserting only the PREFIX, Org will offer specific
     completion support for some link types(3)  For example, if you
     type `file <RET>', file name completion (alternative access: `C-u
     C-c C-l', see below) will be offered, and after `bbdb <RET>' you
     can complete contact names.  

`C-u C-c C-l'
     When `C-c C-l' is called with a `C-u' prefix argument, a link to a
     file will be inserted and you may use file name completion to
     select the name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted
     relative to the directory of the current Org file, if the linked
     file is in the current directory or in a sub-directory of it, or
     if the path is written relative to the current directory using
     `../'.  Otherwise an absolute path is used, if possible with `~/'
     for your home directory.  You can force an absolute path with two
     `C-u' prefixes.

`C-c C-l (with cursor on existing link)'
     When the cursor is on an existing link, `C-c C-l' allows you to
     edit the link and description parts of the link.  

`C-c C-o or <RET>'
     Open link at point.  This will launch a web browser for URLs (using
     `browse-url-at-point'), run VM/MH-E/Wanderlust/Rmail/Gnus/BBDB for
     the corresponding links, and execute the command in a shell link.
     When the cursor is on an internal link, this commands runs the
     corresponding search.  When the cursor is on a TAG list in a
     headline, it creates the corresponding TAGS view.  If the cursor
     is on a timestamp, it compiles the agenda for that date.
     Furthermore, it will visit text and remote files in `file:' links
     with Emacs and select a suitable application for local non-text
     files.  Classification of files is based on file extension only.
     See option `org-file-apps'.  If you want to override the default
     application and visit the file with Emacs, use a `C-u' prefix.  If
     you want to avoid opening in Emacs, use a `C-u C-u' prefix.
     If the cursor is on a headline, but not on a link, offer all links
     in the headline and entry text.  

`mouse-2'
`mouse-1'
     On links, `mouse-2' will open the link just as `C-c C-o' would.
     Under Emacs 22, `mouse-1' will also follow a link.  

`mouse-3'
     Like `mouse-2', but force file links to be opened with Emacs, and
     internal links to be displayed in another window(4).  

`C-c %'
     Push the current position onto the mark ring, to be able to return
     easily. Commands following an internal link do this automatically.  

`C-c &'
     Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
     commands following internal links, and by `C-c %'.  Using this
     command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
     previously recorded positions.  

`C-c C-x C-n'
`C-c C-x C-p'
     Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the
     limit of the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps around.
     The key bindings for this are really too long, you might want to
     bind this also to `C-n' and `C-p'
          (add-hook 'org-load-hook
            (lambda ()
              (define-key 'org-mode-map "\C-n" 'org-next-link)
              (define-key 'org-mode-map "\C-p" 'org-previous-link)))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  Note that you don't have to use this command to insert a link.
Links in Org are plain text, and you can type or paste them straight
into the buffer.  By using this command, the links are automatically
enclosed in double brackets, and you will be asked for the optional
descriptive text.

   (2) After insertion of a stored link, the link will be removed from
the list of stored links.  To keep it in the list later use, use a
triple `C-u' prefix argument to `C-c C-l', or configure the option
`org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion'.

   (3) This works by calling a special function
`org-PREFIX-complete-link'.

   (4) See the variable `org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer'

4.5 Using links outside Org
===========================

You can insert and follow links that have Org syntax not only in Org,
but in any Emacs buffer.  For this, you should create two global
commands, like this (please select suitable global keys yourself):

     (global-set-key "\C-c L" 'org-insert-link-global)
     (global-set-key "\C-c o" 'org-open-at-point-global)


File: org,  Node: Link abbreviations,  Next: Search options,  Prev: Using links outside Org,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.6 Link abbreviations
======================

Long URLs can be cumbersome to type, and often many similar links are
needed in a document.  For this you can use link abbreviations.  An
abbreviated link looks like this

     [[linkword:tag][description]]

where the tag is optional.  The linkword must be a word; letter,
numbers, `-', and `_' are allowed here.  Abbreviations are resolved
according to the information in the variable `org-link-abbrev-alist'
that relates the linkwords to replacement text.  Here is an example:

     (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
       '(("bugzilla" . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
         ("google"   . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
         ("ads"      . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/
                        nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))

   If the replacement text contains the string `%s', it will be
replaced with the tag.  Otherwise the tag will be appended to the string
in order to create the link.  You may also specify a function that will
be called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

   With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
`[[bugzilla:129]]', search the web for `OrgMode' with
`[[google:OrgMode]]' and find out what the Org author is doing besides
Emacs hacking with `[[ads:Dominik,C]]'.

   If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org buffer, you
can define them in the file with

     #+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
     #+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s

In-buffer completion (*note Completion::) can be used after `[' to
complete link abbreviations.  You may also define a function
`org-PREFIX-complete-link' that implements special (e.g., support for
inserting such a link with `C-c C-l'.  Such a function should not
accept any arguments, and return the full link with prefix.


File: org,  Node: Search options,  Next: Custom searches,  Prev: Link abbreviations,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.7 Search options in file links
================================

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double(1) colon. For example,
when the command `C-c l' creates a link (*note Handling links::) to a
file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search string that
can be used to find this line back later when following the link with
`C-c C-o'.

   Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with an explanation:

     [[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]

`255'
     Jump to line 255.

`My Target'
     Search for a link target `<<My Target>>', or do a text search for
     `my target', similar to the search in internal links, see *note
     Internal links::.  In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such a
     file link will become an HTML reference to the corresponding named
     anchor in the linked file.

`*My Target'
     In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.

`/regexp/'
     Do a regular expression search for `regexp'.  This uses the Emacs
     command `occur' to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
     target file is in Org mode, `org-occur' is used to create a sparse
     tree with the matches.

   As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, `[[file:::find me]]' does a
search for `find me' in the current file, just as `[[find me]]' would.

4.8 Custom Searches
===================

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, BibTeX database files have many entries like
`year="1993"' which would not result in good search strings, because
the only unique identification for a BibTeX entry is the citation key.

   If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to
set the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the
search for the string in the file.  Using `add-hook', these functions
need to be added to the hook variables
`org-create-file-search-functions' and
`org-execute-file-search-functions'.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org actually uses this mechanism for
BibTeX database files, and you can use the corresponding code as an
implementation example.  See the file `org-bibtex.el'.

5 TODO Items
************

Org mode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents(1).
Instead, TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because
TODO items usually come up while taking notes!  With Org mode, simply
mark any entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way,
information is not duplicated, and the entire context from which the
TODO item emerged is always present.

   Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them
throughout your notes file.  Org mode compensates for this by providing
methods to give you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

* Menu:

* TODO basics::                 Marking and displaying TODO entries

5.1 Basic TODO functionality
============================

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word `TODO',
for example:

     *** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune

The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

`C-c C-t'
     Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

          ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
          '--------------------------------'

     The same rotation can also be done "remotely" from the timeline and
     agenda buffers with the `t' command key (*note Agenda commands::).

`C-u C-c C-t'
     Select a specific keyword using completion or (if it has been set
     up) the fast selection interface.  For the latter, you need to
     assign keys to TODO states, see *note Per-file keywords::, and
     *note Setting tags::, for more information.

`S-<right>'
`S-<left>'
     Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.
     Useful mostly if more than two TODO states are possible (*note
     TODO extensions::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a discussion
     of the interaction with `shift-selection-mode'.  See also the
     variable `org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change'.  

`C-c C-v'
`C-c / t'
     View TODO items in a _sparse tree_ (*note Sparse trees::).  Folds
     the entire buffer, but shows all TODO items and the headings
     hierarchy above them.  With a prefix argument, search for a
     specific TODO.  You will be prompted for the keyword, and you can
     also give a list of keywords like `KWD1|KWD2|...' to list entries
     that match any one of these keywords.  With numeric prefix
     argument N, show the tree for the Nth keyword in the variable
     `org-todo-keywords'.  With two prefix arguments, find all TODO and
     DONE entries.  

`C-c a t'
     Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items from all agenda
     files (*note Agenda Views::) into a single buffer.  The new buffer
     will be in `agenda-mode', which provides commands to examine and
     manipulate the TODO entries from the new buffer (*note Agenda
     commands::).  *Note Global TODO list::, for more information.  

`S-M-<RET>'
     Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

Changing a TODO state can also trigger tag changes.  See the docstring
of the option `org-todo-state-tags-triggers' for details.

5.2 Extended use of TODO keywords
=================================

By default, marked TODO entries have one of only two states: TODO and
DONE.  Org mode allows you to classify TODO items in more complex ways
with _TODO keywords_ (stored in `org-todo-keywords').  With special
setup, the TODO keyword system can work differently in different files.

   Note that tags are another way to classify headlines in general and
TODO items in particular (*note Tags::).

* Menu:

* Workflow states::             From TODO to DONE in steps
* TODO types::                  I do this, Fred does the rest
* Multiple sets in one file::   Mixing it all, and still finding your way
* Fast access to TODO states::  Single letter selection of a state
* Per-file keywords::           Different files, different requirements
* Faces for TODO keywords::     Highlighting states
* TODO dependencies::           When one task needs to wait for others


File: org,  Node: Workflow states,  Next: TODO types,  Prev: TODO extensions,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.1 TODO keywords as workflow states
--------------------------------------

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different _sequential_ states in
the process of working on an item, for example(1):

     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))

   The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that _need
action_) from the DONE states (which need _no further action_).  If you
don't provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.  With this setup, the command `C-c C-t' will cycle an entry from
TODO to FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and DELEGATED.
You may also use a numeric prefix argument to quickly select a specific
state.  For example `C-3 C-c C-t' will change the state immediately to
VERIFY.  Or you can use `S-<left>' to go backward through the sequence.
If you define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion (*note
Completion::) or even a special one-key selection scheme (*note Fast
access to TODO states::) to insert these words into the buffer.
Changing a TODO state can be logged with a timestamp, see *note
Tracking TODO state changes::, for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Changing this variable only becomes effective after restarting
Org mode in a buffer.


File: org,  Node: TODO types,  Next: Multiple sets in one file,  Prev: Workflow states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.2 TODO keywords as types
----------------------------

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
_types_ of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate that
items are for "work" or "home".  Or, when you work with several people
on a single project, you might want to assign action items directly to
persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would be set up
like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))

   In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but
rather different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a
task to a person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org mode supports this
style by adapting the workings of the command `C-c C-t'(1).  When used
several times in succession, it will still cycle through all names, in
order to first select the right type for a task.  But when you return
to the item after some time and execute `C-c C-t' again, it will switch
from any name directly to DONE.  Use prefix arguments or completion to
quickly select a specific name.  You can also review the items of a
specific TODO type in a sparse tree by using a numeric prefix to `C-c
C-v'.  For example, to see all things Lucy has to do, you would use
`C-3 C-c C-v'.  To collect Lucy's items from all agenda files into a
single buffer, you would use the numeric prefix argument as well when
creating the global TODO list: `C-3 C-c t'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is also true for the `t' command in the timeline and agenda
buffers.


File: org,  Node: Multiple sets in one file,  Next: Fast access to TODO states,  Prev: TODO types,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.3 Multiple keyword sets in one file
---------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic `TODO'/`DONE',
but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a separate state indicating
that an item has been canceled (so it is not DONE, but also does not
require action).  Your setup would then look like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
             (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))

   The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode to keep
track of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this
setup, `C-c C-t' only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
`DONE' to (nothing) to `TODO', and from `FIXED' to (nothing) to
`REPORT'.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially select the
correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a keyword or
using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

`C-u C-u C-c C-t'
`C-S-<right>'
`C-S-<left>'
     These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above
     example, `C-u C-u C-c C-t' or `C-S-<right>' would jump from `TODO'
     or `DONE' to `REPORT', and any of the words in the second row to
     `CANCELED'.  Note that the `C-S-' key binding conflict with
     `shift-selection-mode' (*note Conflicts::).  

`S-<right>'
`S-<left>'
     `S-<<left>>' and `S-<<right>>' and walk through _all_ keywords
     from all sets, so for example `S-<<right>>' would switch from
     `DONE' to `REPORT' in the example above.  See also *note
     Conflicts::, for a discussion of the interaction with
     `shift-selection-mode'.

5.2.4 Fast access to TODO states
--------------------------------

If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for
single-letter access to the states.  This is done by adding the section
key after each keyword, in parentheses.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
             (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))

   If you then press `C-c C-t' followed by the selection key, the entry
will be switched to this state.  <SPC> can be used to remove any TODO
keyword from an entry.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Check also the variable `org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo',
it allows you to change the TODO state through the tags interface
(*note Setting tags::), in case you like to mingle the two concepts.
Note that this means you need to come up with unique keys across both
sets of keywords.


File: org,  Node: Per-file keywords,  Next: Faces for TODO keywords,  Prev: Fast access to TODO states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.5 Setting up keywords for individual files
----------------------------------------------

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

     #+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
   (you may also write `#+SEQ_TODO' to be explicit about the
interpretation, but it means the same as `#+TODO'), or
     #+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE

   A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

     #+TODO: TODO | DONE
     #+TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
     #+TODO: | CANCELED

To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type `#+' into the
buffer and then use `M-<TAB>' completion.

   Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar (or the last
keyword if no bar is there) must always mean that the item is DONE
(although you may use a different word).  After changing one of these
lines, use `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the line to make the
changes known to Org mode(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org mode parses these lines only when Org mode is activated
after visiting a file.  `C-c C-c' with the cursor in a line starting
with `#+' is simply restarting Org mode for the current buffer.


File: org,  Node: Faces for TODO keywords,  Next: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Per-file keywords,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.6 Faces for TODO keywords
-----------------------------

Org mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: `org-todo' for
keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
`org-done' for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If you
are using more than 2 different states, you might want to use special
faces for some of them.  This can be done using the variable
`org-todo-keyword-faces'.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("TODO"      . org-warning)
             ("DEFERRED"  . shadow)
             ("CANCELED"  . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))

   While using a list with face properties as shown for CANCELED
_should_ work, this does not aways seem to be the case.  If necessary,
define a special face and use that.


File: org,  Node: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Faces for TODO keywords,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.7 TODO dependencies
-----------------------

The structure of Org files (hierarchy and lists) makes it easy to
define TODO dependencies.  Usually, a parent TODO task should not be
marked DONE until all subtasks (defined as children tasks) are marked
as DONE.  And sometimes there is a logical sequence to a number of
(sub)tasks, so that one task cannot be acted upon before all siblings
above it are done.  If you customize the variable
`org-enforce-todo-dependencies', Org will block entries from changing
state to DONE while they have children that are not DONE.  Furthermore,
if an entry has a property `ORDERED', each of its children will be
blocked until all earlier siblings are marked DONE.  Here is an example:

     * TODO Blocked until (two) is done
     ** DONE one
     ** TODO two

     * Parent
       :PROPERTIES:
         :ORDERED: t
       :END:
     ** TODO a
     ** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
     ** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)

`C-c C-x o'
     Toggle the `ORDERED' property of the current entry.  A property is
     used for this behavior because this should be local to the current
     entry, not inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to
     track the value of this property with a tag for better visibility,
     customize the variable `org-track-ordered-property-with-tag'.  

`C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t'
     Change TODO state, circumventing any state blocking.

   If you set the variable `org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks', TODO entries
that cannot be closed because of such dependencies will be shown in a
dimmed font or even made invisible in agenda views (*note Agenda
Views::).

   You can also block changes of TODO states by looking at checkboxes
(*note Checkboxes::).  If you set the variable
`org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies', an entry that has unchecked
checkboxes will be blocked from switching to DONE.

   If you need more complex dependency structures, for example
dependencies between entries in different trees or files, check out the
contributed module `org-depend.el'.


File: org,  Node: Progress logging,  Next: Priorities,  Prev: TODO extensions,  Up: TODO Items

5.3 Progress logging
====================

Org mode can automatically record a timestamp and possibly a note when
you mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of
a TODO item.  This system is highly configurable, settings can be on a
per-keyword basis and can be localized to a file or even a subtree.  For
information on how to clock working time for a task, see *note Clocking
work time::.

* Menu:

* Closing items::               When was this entry marked DONE?
* Tracking TODO state changes::  When did the status change?


File: org,  Node: Closing items,  Next: Tracking TODO state changes,  Prev: Progress logging,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.1 Closing items
-------------------

The most basic logging is to keep track of _when_ a certain TODO item
was finished.  This is achieved with(1).

     (setq org-log-done 'time)

Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done) state into any
of the DONE states, a line `CLOSED: [timestamp]' will be inserted just
after the headline.  If you turn the entry back into a TODO item
through further state cycling, that line will be removed again.  If you
want to record a note along with the timestamp, use(2)

     (setq org-log-done 'note)

You will then be prompted for a note, and that note will be stored below
the entry with a `Closing Note' heading.

   In the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in the agenda (*note
Weekly/daily agenda::), you can then use the `l' key to display the
TODO items with a `CLOSED' timestamp on each day, giving you an
overview of what has been done.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: logdone'

   (2) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: lognotedone'


File: org,  Node: Tracking TODO state changes,  Prev: Closing items,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.2 Tracking TODO state changes
---------------------------------

When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (*note Workflow
states::), you might want to keep track of when a state change occurred
and maybe take a note about this change.  You can either record just a
timestamp, or a time-stamped note for a change.  These records will be
inserted after the headline as an itemized list, newest first(1).  When
taking a lot of notes, you might want to get the notes out of the way
into a drawer (*note Drawers::).  Customize the variable
`org-log-into-drawer' to get this behavior--the recommended drawer for
this is called `LOGBOOK'.  You can also overrule the setting of this
variable for a subtree by setting a `LOG_INTO_DRAWER' property.

   Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org
mode expects configuration on a per-keyword basis for this.  This is
achieved by adding special markers `!' (for a timestamp) and `@' (for a
note) in parentheses after each keyword.  For example, with the setting

     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@)")))

you not only define global TODO keywords and fast access keys, but also
request that a time is recorded when the entry is set to DONE(2), and
that a note is recorded when switching to WAIT or CANCELED.  The
setting for WAIT is even more special: the `!' after the slash means
that in addition to the note taken when entering the state, a timestamp
should be recorded when leaving the WAIT state, if and only if the
target state does not configure logging for entering it.  So it has no
effect when switching from WAIT to DONE, because DONE is configured to
record a timestamp only.  But when switching from WAIT back to TODO,
the `/!' in the WAIT setting now triggers a timestamp even though TODO
has no logging configured.

   You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences
local to a buffer:
     #+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

   In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a
single item, define a LOGGING property in this entry.  Any non-empty
LOGGING property resets all logging settings to nil.  You may then turn
on logging for this specific tree using STARTUP keywords like
`lognotedone' or `logrepeat', as well as adding state specific settings
like `TODO(!)'.  For example

     * TODO Log each state with only a time
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: TODO(!) WAIT(!) DONE(!) CANCELED(!)
       :END:
     * TODO Only log when switching to WAIT, and when repeating
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: WAIT(@) logrepeat
       :END:
     * TODO No logging at all
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: nil
       :END:

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-log-states-order-reversed'

   (2) It is possible that Org mode will record two timestamps when you
are using both `org-log-done' and state change logging.  However, it
will never prompt for two notes--if you have configured both, the state
change recording note will take precedence and cancel the `Closing
Note'.


File: org,  Node: Priorities,  Next: Breaking down tasks,  Prev: Progress logging,  Up: TODO Items

5.4 Priorities
==============

If you use Org mode extensively, you may end up enough TODO items that
it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be done by
placing a _priority cookie_ into the headline of a TODO item, like this

     *** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

By default, Org mode supports three priorities: `A', `B', and `C'.  `A'
is the highest priority.  An entry without a cookie is treated as
priority `B'.  Priorities make a difference only in the agenda (*note
Weekly/daily agenda::); outside the agenda, they have no inherent
meaning to Org mode.

   Priorities can be attached to any outline tree entries; they do not
need to be TODO items.

`C-c ,'
     Set the priority of the current headline.  The command prompts for
     a priority character `A', `B' or `C'.  When you press <SPC>
     instead, the priority cookie is removed from the headline.  The
     priorities can also be changed "remotely" from the timeline and
     agenda buffer with the `,' command (*note Agenda commands::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Increase/decrease priority of current headline(1).  Note that
     these keys are also used to modify timestamps (*note Creating
     timestamps::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a discussion of
     the interaction with `shift-selection-mode'.

   You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the
variables `org-highest-priority', `org-lowest-priority', and
`org-default-priority'.  For an individual buffer, you may set these
values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that the
highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest priority):

     #+PRIORITIES: A C B

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the option `org-priority-start-cycle-with-default'.


File: org,  Node: Breaking down tasks,  Next: Checkboxes,  Prev: Priorities,  Up: TODO Items

5.5 Breaking tasks down into subtasks
=====================================

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO
item, with detailed subtasks on the tree(1).  To keep the overview over
the fraction of subtasks that are already completed, insert either
`[/]' or `[%]' anywhere in the headline.  These cookies will be updates
each time the todo status of a child changes, or when pressing `C-c
C-c' on the cookie.  For example:

     * Organize Party [33%]
     ** TODO Call people [1/2]
     *** TODO Peter
     *** DONE Sarah
     ** TODO Buy food
     ** DONE Talk to neighbor

   If a heading has both checkboxes and TODO children below it, the
meaning of the statistics cookie become ambiguous.  Set the property
`COOKIE_DATA' to either `checkbox' or `todo' to resolve this issue.

   If you would like to have the statistics cookie count any TODO
entries in the subtree (not just direct children), confgure the variable
`org-hierarchical-todo-statistics'.  To do this for a single subtree,
include the word `recursive' into the value of the `COOKIE_DATA'
property.

     * Parent capturing statistics [2/20]
       :PROPERTIES:
       :COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
       :END:

   If you would like a TODO entry to automatically change to DONE when
all children are done, you can use the following setup:

     (defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
       "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
       (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
         (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

     (add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)

   Another possibility is the use of checkboxes to identify (a
hierarchy of) a large number of subtasks (*note Checkboxes::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To keep subtasks out of the global TODO list, see the
`org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels'.


File: org,  Node: Checkboxes,  Prev: Breaking down tasks,  Up: TODO Items

5.6 Checkboxes
==============

Every item in a plain list (*note Plain lists::) can be made into a
checkbox by starting it with the string `[ ]'.  This feature is similar
to TODO items (*note TODO Items::), but is more lightweight.
Checkboxes are not included into the global TODO list, so they are often
great to split a task into a number of simple steps.  Or you can use
them in a shopping list.  To toggle a checkbox, use `C-c C-c', or use
the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski's `org-mouse.el').

   Here is an example of a checkbox list.

     * TODO Organize party [2/4]
       - [-] call people [1/3]
         - [ ] Peter
         - [X] Sarah
         - [ ] Sam
       - [X] order food
       - [ ] think about what music to play
       - [X] talk to the neighbors

   Checkboxes work hierarchically, so if a checkbox item has children
that are checkboxes, toggling one of the children checkboxes will make
the parent checkbox reflect if none, some, or all of the children are
checked.

   The `[2/4]' and `[1/3]' in the first and second line are cookies
indicating how many checkboxes present in this entry have been checked
off, and the total number of checkboxes present.  This can give you an
idea on how many checkboxes remain, even without opening a folded
entry.  The cookies can be placed into a headline or into (the first
line of) a plain list item.  Each cookie covers checkboxes of direct
children structurally below the headline/item on which the cookie
appears(1).  You have to insert the cookie yourself by typing either
`[/]' or `[%]'.  With `[/]' you get an `n out of m' result, as in the
examples above.  With `[%]' you get information about the percentage of
checkboxes checked (in the above example, this would be `[50%]' and
`[33%]', respectively).  In a headline, a cookie can count either
checkboxes below the heading or TODO states of children, and it will
display whatever was changed last.  Set the property `COOKIE_DATA' to
either `checkbox' or `todo' to resolve this issue.

   If the current outline node has an `ORDERED' property, checkboxes
must be checked off in sequence, and an error will be thrown if you try
to check off a box while there are unchecked boxes above it.

The following commands work with checkboxes:

`C-c C-c'
     Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at
     point.  With double prefix argument, set it to `[-]', which is
     considered to be an intermediate state.  

`C-c C-x C-b'
     Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at
     point.  With double prefix argument, set it to `[-]', which is
     considered to be an intermediate state.
        - If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in
          the region and set all remaining boxes to the same status as
          the first.  With a prefix arg, add or remove the checkbox for
          all items in the region.

        - If the cursor is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the
          region between this headline and the next (so _not_ the
          entire subtree).

        - If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at
          point.
     
`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox.  This works only if the cursor
     is already in a plain list item (*note Plain lists::).  

`C-c C-x o'
     Toggle the `ORDERED' property of the entry, to toggle if
     checkboxes must be checked off in sequence.  A property is used
     for this behavior because this should be local to the current
     entry, not inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to
     track the value of this property with a tag for better visibility,
     customize the variable `org-track-ordered-property-with-tag'.  

`C-c #'
     Update the statistics cookie in the current outline entry.  When
     called with a `C-u' prefix, update the entire file.  Checkbox
     statistic cookies are updated automatically if you toggle
     checkboxes with `C-c C-c' and make new ones with `M-S-<RET>'.
     TODO statistics cookies update when changing TODO states.  If you
     delete boxes/entries or add/change them by hand, use this command
     to get things back into sync.  Or simply toggle any entry twice
     (checkboxes with `C-c C-c').

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Set the variable `org-hierarchical-checkbox-statistics' if you
want such cookies to represent the all checkboxes below the cookie, not
just the direct children.

6 Tags
******

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign tags to headlines.  Org mode has extensive
support for tags.

   Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of
the headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, `_',
and `@'.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g.,,
`:work:'.  Several tags can be specified, as in `:work:urgent:'.  Tags
will by default be in bold face with the same color as the headline.
You may specify special faces for specific tags using the variable
`org-tag-faces', in much the same way as you can for TODO keywords
(*note Faces for TODO keywords::).

* Tag searches::                Searching for combinations of tags


File: org,  Node: Tag inheritance,  Next: Setting tags,  Prev: Tags,  Up: Tags

6.1 Tag inheritance
===================

Tags make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit the tag as
well.  For example, in the list

     * Meeting with the French group      :work:
     ** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
     *** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:

the final heading will have the tags `:work:', `:boss:', `:notes:', and
`:action:' even though the final heading is not explicitly marked with
those tags.  You can also set tags that all entries in a file should
inherit just as if these tags were defined in a hypothetical level zero
that surrounds the entire file.  Use a line like this(1):

     #+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:

To limit tag inheritance to specific tags, or to turn it off entirely,
use the variables `org-use-tag-inheritance' and
`org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance'.

   When a headline matches during a tags search while tag inheritance
is turned on, all the sublevels in the same tree will (for a simple
match form) match as well(2).  The list of matches may then become very
long.  If you only want to see the first tags match in a subtree,
configure the variable `org-tags-match-list-sublevels' (not
recommended).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As with all these in-buffer settings, pressing `C-c C-c'
activates any changes in the line.

   (2) This is only true if the search does not involve more complex
tests including properties (*note Property searches::).


File: org,  Node: Setting tags,  Next: Tag searches,  Prev: Tag inheritance,  Up: Tags

6.2 Setting tags
================

Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, `M-<TAB>' offers completion on tags.  There is also a
special command for inserting tags:

`C-c C-q'
     Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org mode will either
     offer completion or a special single-key interface for setting
     tags, see below.  After pressing <RET>, the tags will be inserted
     and aligned to `org-tags-column'.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix, all tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that
     column, just to make things look nice.  TAGS are automatically
     realigned after promotion, demotion, and TODO state changes (*note
     TODO basics::).  

`C-c C-c'
     When the cursor is in a headline, this does the same as `C-c C-q'.

   Org will support tag insertion based on a _list of tags_.  By
default this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags
currently used in the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list
of tags with the variable `org-tag-alist'.  Finally you can set the
default tags for a given file with lines like

     #+TAGS: @work @home @tennisclub
     #+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat

   If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable `org-tag-alist', but would like to use a dynamic tag list in a
specific file, add an empty TAGS option line to that file:

     #+TAGS:

   If you have a preferred set of tags that you would like to use in
every file, in addition to those defined on a per-file basis by TAGS
option lines, then you may specify a list of tags with the variable
`org-tag-persistent-alist'.  You may turn this off on a per-file basis
by adding a STARTUP option line to that file:

     #+STARTUP: noptag

   By default Org mode uses the standard minibuffer completion
facilities for entering tags.  However, it also implements another,
quicker, tag selection method called _fast tag selection_.  This allows
you to select and deselect tags with just a single key press.  For this
to work well you should assign unique letters to most of your commonly
used tags.  You can do this globally by configuring the variable
`org-tag-alist' in your `.emacs' file.  For example, you may find the
need to tag many items in different files with `:@home:'.  In this case
you can set something like:

     (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))

If the tag is only relevant to the file you are working on, then you
can instead set the TAGS option line as:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)

The tags interface will show the available tags in a splash window.  If
you want to start a new line after a specific tag, insert `\n' into the
tag list

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) \n laptop(l)  pc(p)

or write them in two lines:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)
     #+TAGS: laptop(l)  pc(p)

You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive by using
braces, as in:

     #+TAGS: { @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) }  laptop(l)  pc(p)

you indicate that at most one of `@work', `@home', and `@tennisclub'
should be selected.  Multiple such groups are allowed.

Don't forget to press `C-c C-c' with the cursor in one of these lines
to activate any changes.

To set these mutually exclusive groups in the variable `org-tags-alist',
you must use the dummy tags `:startgroup' and `:endgroup' instead of
the braces.  Similarly, you can use `:newline' to indicate a line
break.  The previous example would be set globally by the following
configuration:

     (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                           ("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h)
                           ("@tennisclub" . ?t)
                           (:endgroup . nil)
                           ("laptop" . ?l) ("pc" . ?p)))

   If at least one tag has a selection key then pressing `C-c C-c' will
automatically present you with a special interface, listing inherited
tags, the tags of the current headline, and a list of all valid tags
with corresponding keys(1).  In this interface, you can use the
following keys:

`a-z...'
     Pressing keys assigned to tags will add or remove them from the
     list of tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of
     mutually exclusive tags will turn off any other tags from that
     group.  

`<TAB>'
     Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the
     predefined list.  You will be able to complete on all tags present
     in the buffer.  

`<SPC>'
     Clear all tags for this line.  

`<RET>'
     Accept the modified set.

`C-g'
     Abort without installing changes.

`q'
     If `q' is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like `C-g'.

`!'
     Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
     exception) assign several tags from such a group.

`C-c'
     Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).  If you are
     using expert mode, the first `C-c' will display the selection
     window.

This method lets you assign tags to a headline with very few keys.  With
the above setup, you could clear the current tags and set `@home',
`laptop' and `pc' tags with just the following keys: `C-c C-c <SPC> h l
p <RET>'.  Switching from `@home' to `@work' would be done with `C-c
C-c w <RET>' or alternatively with `C-c C-c C-c w'.  Adding the
non-predefined tag `Sarah' could be done with `C-c C-c <TAB> S a r a h
<RET> <RET>'.

   If you find that most of the time you need only a single key press to
modify your list of tags, set the variable
`org-fast-tag-selection-single-key'.  Then you no longer have to press
<RET> to exit fast tag selection--it will immediately exit after the
first change.  If you then occasionally need more keys, press `C-c' to
turn off auto-exit for the current tag selection process (in effect:
start selection with `C-c C-c C-c' instead of `C-c C-c').  If you set
the variable to the value `expert', the special window is not even
shown for single-key tag selection, it comes up only when you press an
extra `C-c'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Keys will automatically be assigned to tags which have no
configured keys.

6.3 Tag searches
================

Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

`C-c \'
`C-c / m'
     Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search.
     With a `C-u' prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO
     line.  

`C-c a m'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files.  *Note
     Matching tags and properties::.  

`C-c a M'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').

   These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic
Boolean logic like `+boss+urgent-project1', to find entries with tags
`boss' and `urgent', but not `project1', or `Kathy|Sally' to find
entries which are tagged, like `Kathy' or `Sally'.  The full syntax of
the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO
keywords, entry levels and properties.  For a complete description with
many examples, see *note Matching tags and properties::.

7 Properties and Columns
************************

Properties are a set of key-value pairs associated with an entry.  There
are two main applications for properties in Org mode.  First, properties
are like tags, but with a value.  Second, you can use properties to
implement (very basic) database capabilities in an Org buffer.  For an
example of the first application, imagine maintaining a file where you
document bugs and plan releases for a piece of software.  Instead of
using tags like `:release_1:', `:release_2:', one can use a property,
say `:Release:', that in different subtrees has different values, such
as `1.0' or `2.0'.  For an example of the second application of
properties, imagine keeping track of your music CDs, where properties
could be things such as the album, artist, date of release, number of
tracks, and so on.

   Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view
(*note Column view::).

File: org,  Node: Property syntax,  Next: Special properties,  Prev: Properties and Columns,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.1 Property syntax
===================

Properties are key-value pairs.  They need to be inserted into a special
drawer (*note Drawers::) with the name `PROPERTIES'.  Each property is
specified on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons) first,
and the value after it.  Here is an example:

     * CD collection
     ** Classic
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Artist:    Glen Gould
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :END:

   You may define the allowed values for a particular property `:Xyz:'
by setting a property `:Xyz_ALL:'.  This special property is
_inherited_, so if you set it in a level 1 entry, it will apply to the
entire tree.  When allowed values are defined, setting the
corresponding property becomes easier and is less prone to typing
errors.  For the example with the CD collection, we can predefine
publishers and the number of disks in a box like this:

     * CD collection
       :PROPERTIES:
       :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
       :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
       :END:

   If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like 
     #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

   Property values set with the global variable `org-global-properties'
can be inherited by all entries in all Org files.

The following commands help to work with properties:

`M-<TAB>'
     After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All
     keys used in the current file will be offered as possible
     completions.  

`C-c C-x p'
     Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
     necessary, the property drawer is created as well.

`M-x org-insert-property-drawer'
     Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer will
     be inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
     information like deadlines.  

`C-c C-c'
     With the cursor in a property drawer, this executes property
     commands.

`C-c C-c s'
     Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the
     value can be inserted using completion.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     Switch property at point to the next/previous allowed value.

`C-c C-c d'
     Remove a property from the current entry.

`C-c C-c D'
     Globally remove a property, from all entries in the current file.

`C-c C-c c'
     Compute the property at point, using the operator and scope from
     the nearest column format definition.


File: org,  Node: Special properties,  Next: Property searches,  Prev: Property syntax,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.2 Special properties
======================

Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode
features, like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed in
the previous chapters.  This interface exists so that you can include
these states in a column view (*note Column view::), or to use them in
queries.  The following property names are special and should not be
used as keys in the properties drawer:

     TODO         The TODO keyword of the entry.
     TAGS         The tags defined directly in the headline.
     ALLTAGS      All tags, including inherited ones.
     CATEGORY     The category of an entry.
     PRIORITY     The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.
     DEADLINE     The deadline time string, without the angular brackets.
     SCHEDULED    The scheduling timestamp, without the angular brackets.
     CLOSED       When was this entry closed?
     TIMESTAMP    The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.
     TIMESTAMP_IA The first inactive timestamp in the entry.
     CLOCKSUM     The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree.  `org-clock-sum'
                  must be run first to compute the values.
     ITEM         The content of the entry.


File: org,  Node: Property searches,  Next: Property inheritance,  Prev: Special properties,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.3 Property searches
=====================

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on
properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (*note Tag
searches::).
`C-c \'
`C-c / m'
     Create a sparse tree with all matching entries.  With a `C-u'
     prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.  

`C-c a m'
     Create a global list of tag/property  matches from all agenda
     files.  *Note Matching tags and properties::.  

`C-c a M'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking of subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').

   The syntax for the search string is described in *note Matching tags
and properties::.

   There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

`C-c / p'
     Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
     prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A
     sparse tree is created with all entries that define this property
     with the given value.  If you enclose the value into curly braces,
     it is interpreted as a regular expression and matched against the
     property values.


File: org,  Node: Property inheritance,  Next: Column view,  Prev: Property searches,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.4 Property Inheritance
========================

The outline structure of Org-mode documents lends itself for an
inheritance model of properties: if the parent in a tree has a certain
property, the children can inherit this property.  Org mode does not
turn this on by default, because it can slow down property searches
significantly and is often not needed.  However, if you find inheritance
useful, you can turn it on by setting the variable
`org-use-property-inheritance'.  It may be set to `t' to make all
properties inherited from the parent, to a list of properties that
should be inherited, or to a regular expression that matches inherited
properties.

   Org mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:

`COLUMNS'
     The `:COLUMNS:' property defines the format of column view (*note
     Column view::).  It is inherited in the sense that the level where
     a `:COLUMNS:' property is defined is used as the starting point
     for a column view table, independently of the location in the
     subtree from where columns view is turned on.

`CATEGORY'
     For agenda view, a category set through a `:CATEGORY:' property
     applies to the entire subtree.

`ARCHIVE'
     For archiving, the `:ARCHIVE:' property may define the archive
     location for the entire subtree (*note Moving subtrees::).

`LOGGING'
     The LOGGING property may define logging settings for an entry or a
     subtree (*note Tracking TODO state changes::).


File: org,  Node: Column view,  Next: Property API,  Prev: Property inheritance,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.5 Column view
===============

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is _column
view_.  In column view, each outline node is turned into a table row.
Columns in this table provide access to properties of the entries.  Org
mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure over the
headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned into a
table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline tree.
For example, you get a compact table by switching to CONTENTS view
(`S-<TAB> S-<TAB>', or simply `c' while column view is active), but you
can still open, read, and edit the entry below each headline.  Or, you
can switch to column view after executing a sparse tree command and in
this way get a table only for the selected items.  Column view also
works in agenda buffers (*note Agenda Views::) where queries have
collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

7.5.1 Defining columns
----------------------

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns.  This is
done by defining a column format line.

* Menu:

* Scope of column definitions::  Where defined, where valid?
* Column attributes::           Appearance and content of a column


File: org,  Node: Scope of column definitions,  Next: Column attributes,  Prev: Defining columns,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.1 Scope of column definitions
...................................

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like

     #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO

   To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a
`:COLUMNS:' property to the top node of that tree, for example:

     ** Top node for columns view
        :PROPERTIES:
        :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
        :END:

   If a `:COLUMNS:' property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the document,
you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough for all
sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you edit a
deeper part of the tree.


File: org,  Node: Column attributes,  Prev: Scope of column definitions,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.2 Column attributes
.........................

A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

      %[WIDTH]PROPERTY[(TITLE)][{SUMMARY-TYPE}]

Except for the percent sign and the property name, all items are
optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

     WIDTH           An integer specifying the width of the column in characters.
                     If omitted, the width will be determined automatically.
     PROPERTY        The property that should be edited in this column.
     (title)         The header text for the column. If omitted, the
                     property name is used.
     {SUMMARY-TYPE}  The summary type.  If specified, the column values for
                     parent nodes are computed from the children.
                     Supported summary types are:
                     {+}       Sum numbers in this column.
                     {+;%.1f}  Like `+', but format result with `%.1f'.
                     {$}       Currency, short for `+;%.2f'.
                     {:}       Sum times, HH:MM:SS, plain numbers are hours.
                     {X}       Checkbox status, `[X]' if all children are `[X]'.
                     {X/}      Checkbox status, `[n/m]'.
                     {X%}      Checkbox status, `[n%]'.
                     {min}     Smallest number in column.
                     {max}     Largest number.
                     {mean}    Arithmetic mean of numbers.
                     {:min}    Smallest time value in column.
                     {:max}    Largest time value.
                     {:mean}   Arithmetic mean of time values.

Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with allowed
values.

     :COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %9Approved(Approved?){X} %Owner %11Status \(1)
                        %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM
     :Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
     :Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
     :Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"

The first column, `%25ITEM', means the first 25 characters of the item
itself, i.e., column definition with the `ITEM' specifier.  The other
specifiers create columns `Owner' with a list of names as allowed
values, for `Status' with four different possible values, and for a
checkbox field `Approved'.  When no width is given after the `%'
character, the column will be exactly as wide as it needs to be in order
to fully display all values.  The `Approved' column does have a
modified title (`Approved?', with a question mark).  Summaries will be
created for the `Time_Estimate' column by adding time duration
expressions like HH:MM, and for the `Approved' column, by providing an
`[X]' status if all children have been checked.  The `CLOCKSUM' column
is special, it lists the sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree.

   (1) Please note that the COLUMNS definition must be on a single
line--it is wrapped here only because of formatting constraints.

7.5.2 Using column view
-----------------------

Turning column view on and off
..............................

`C-c C-x C-c'
     Turn on column view.  If the cursor is before the first headline
     in the file, column view is turned on for the entire file, using
     the `#+COLUMNS' definition.  If the cusor is somewhere inside the
     outline, this command searches the hierarchy, up from point, for a
     `:COLUMNS:' property that defines a format.  When one is found,
     the column view table is established for the tree starting at the
     entry that contains the `:COLUMNS:' property.  If no such property
     is found, the format is taken from the `#+COLUMNS' line or from
     the variable `org-columns-default-format', and column view is
     established for the current entry and its subtree.  

`r'
     Recreate the column view, to include recent changes made in the
     buffer.  

`g'
     Same as `r'.  

`q'
     Exit column view.

Editing values
..............

`<left> <right> <up> <down>'
     Move through the column view from field to field.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.  For this,
     you have to have specified allowed values for a property.

`1..9,0'
     Directly select the nth allowed value, `0' selects the 10th value.  

`n / p'
     Same as `S-<left>/<right>' 

`e'
     Edit the property at point.  For the special properties, this will
     invoke the same interface that you normally use to change that
     property.  For example, when editing a TAGS property, the tag
     completion or fast selection interface will pop up.  

`C-c C-c'
     When there is a checkbox at point, toggle it.  

`v'
     View the full value of this property.  This is useful if the width
     of the column is smaller than that of the value.  

`a'
     Edit the list of allowed values for this property.  If the list is
     found in the hierarchy, the modified values is stored there.  If
     no list is found, the new value is stored in the first entry that
     is part of the current column view.

Modifying the table structure
.............................

`< / >'
     Make the column narrower/wider by one character.  

`S-M-<right>'
     Insert a new column, to the left of the current column.  

`S-M-<left>'
     Delete the current column.


File: org,  Node: Capturing column view,  Prev: Using column view,  Up: Column view

7.5.3 Capturing column view
---------------------------

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view, use
a `columnview' dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::).  The frame of
this block looks like this:

     * The column view
     #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

     #+END:

This dynamic block has the following parameters:

`:id'
     This is the most important parameter.  Column view is a feature
     that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture
     block might be at a different location in the file.  To identify
     the tree whose view to capture, you can use 4 values: 
          local     use the tree in which the capture block is located
          global    make a global view, including all headings in the file
          "file:PATH-TO-FILE"
                    run column view at the top of this file
          "ID"      call column view in the tree that has an `:ID:'
                    property with the value label.  You can use
                    `M-x org-id-copy' to create a globally unique ID for
                    the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.

`:hlines'
     When `t', insert an hline after every line.  When a number N,
     insert an hline before each headline with level `<= N'.

`:vlines'
     When set to `t', force column groups to get vertical lines.

`:maxlevel'
     When set to a number, don't capture entries below this level.

`:skip-empty-rows'
     When set to `t', skip rows where the only non-empty specifier of
     the column view is `ITEM'.


The following commands insert or update the dynamic block:

`C-c C-x i'
     Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  You will be
     prompted for the scope or ID of the view.  

`C-c C-c'
`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks in a buffer.

   You can add formulas to the column view table and you may add
plotting instructions in front of the table--these will survive an
update of the block.  If there is a `#+TBLFM:' after the table, the
table will actually be recalculated automatically after an update.

   An alternative way to capture and process property values into a
table is provided by Eric Schulte's `org-collector.el' which is a
contributed package(1).  It provides a general API to collect
properties from entries in a certain scope, and arbitrary Lisp
expressions to process these values before inserting them into a table
or a dynamic block.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Contributed packages are not part of Emacs, but are distributed
with the main distribution of Org (visit `http://orgmode.org').

7.6 The Property API

There is a full API for accessing and changing properties.  This API can
be used by Emacs Lisp programs to work with properties and to implement

8 Dates and Times
*****************

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a _timestamp_ in Org mode.  This may be a little
confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when something
was created or last changed.  However, in Org mode this term is used in
a much wider sense.

File: org,  Node: Timestamps,  Next: Creating timestamps,  Prev: Dates and Times,  Up: Dates and Times

8.1 Timestamps, deadlines, and scheduling
=========================================

A timestamp is a specification of a date (possibly with a time or a
range of times) in a special format, either `<2003-09-16 Tue>' or
`<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>' or `<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>'(1).  A
timestamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an Org tree
entry.  Its presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in
the agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).  We distinguish:

PLAIN TIMESTAMP; EVENT; APPOINTMENT
     A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is
     just like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.
     In the timeline and agenda displays, the headline of an entry
     associated with a plain timestamp will be shown exactly on that
     date.

          * Meet Peter at the movies <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
          * Discussion on climate change <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>

TIMESTAMP WITH REPEATER INTERVAL
     A timestamp may contain a _repeater interval_, indicating that it
     applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a
     certain interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years
     (y).  The following will show up in the agenda every Wednesday:

          * Pick up Sam at school <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

DIARY-STYLE SEXP ENTRIES
     For more complex date specifications, Org mode supports using the
     special sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
     package.  For example

          * The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
            <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>

TIME/DATE RANGE
     Two timestamps connected by `--' denote a range.  The headline
     will be shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any
     dates that are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an
     example:

          ** Meeting in Amsterdam
             <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>

INACTIVE TIMESTAMP
     Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of
     angular ones.  These timestamps are inactive in the sense that
     they do _not_ trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

          * Gillian comes late for the fifth time [2006-11-01 Wed]


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is inspired by the standard ISO 6801 date/time format.  To
use an alternative format, see *note Custom time format::.


File: org,  Node: Creating timestamps,  Next: Deadlines and scheduling,  Prev: Timestamps,  Up: Dates and Times

8.2 Creating timestamps
=======================

For Org mode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct
format.

`C-c .'
     Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.  When the
     cursor is at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is
     used to modify this timestamp instead of inserting a new one.
     When this command is used twice in succession, a time range is
     inserted.  

`C-c !'
     Like `C-c .', but insert an inactive timestamp that will not cause
     an agenda entry.  

`C-u C-c .'
`C-u C-c !'
     Like `C-c .' and `C-c !', but use the alternative format which
     contains date and time.  The default time can be rounded to
     multiples of 5 minutes, see the option
     `org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes'.  

`C-c <'
     Insert a timestamp corresponding to the cursor date in the
     Calendar.  

`C-c >'
     Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
     timestamp in the current line, go to the corresponding date
     instead.  

`C-c C-o'
     Access the agenda for the date given by the timestamp or -range at
     point (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).  

`S-<left>'
`S-<right>'
     Change date at cursor by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
     shift-selection and related modes (*note Conflicts::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.  The cursor can
     be on a year, month, day, hour or minute.  When the timestamp
     contains a time range like `15:30-16:30', modifying the first time
     will also shift the second, shifting the time block with constant
     length.  To change the length, modify the second time.  Note that
     if the cursor is in a headline and not at a timestamp, these same
     keys modify the priority of an item.  (*note Priorities::). The
     key bindings also conflict with shift-selection and related modes
     (*note Conflicts::).  

`C-c C-y'
     Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start
     and end.  With a prefix argument, insert result after the time
     range (in a table: into the following column).

File: org,  Node: The date/time prompt,  Next: Custom time format,  Prev: Creating timestamps,  Up: Creating timestamps

8.2.1 The date/time prompt
--------------------------

When Org mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown in default
date/time format, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for a specific
format.  But it will in fact accept any string containing some date
and/or time information, and it is really smart about interpreting your
input.  You can, for example, use `C-y' to paste a (possibly
multi-line) string copied from an email message.  Org mode will find
whatever information is in there and derive anything you have not
specified from the _default date and time_.  The default is usually the
current date and time, but when modifying an existing timestamp, or
when entering the second stamp of a range, it is taken from the stamp
in the buffer.  When filling in information, Org mode assumes that most
of the time you will want to enter a date in the future: if you omit
the month/year and the given day/month is before today, it will assume
that you mean a future date(1).

   For example, let's assume that today is June 13, 2006.  Here is how
various inputs will be interpreted, the items filled in by Org mode are
in bold.

     3-2-5         --> 2003-02-05
     14            --> 2006-06-14
     12            --> 2006-07-12
     Fri           --> nearest Friday (defaultdate or later)
     sep 15        --> 2006-09-15
     feb 15        --> 2007-02-15
     sep 12 9      --> 2009-09-12
     12:45         --> 2006-06-13 12:45
     22 sept 0:34  --> 2006-09-22 0:34
     w4            --> ISO week for of the current year 2006
     2012 w4 fri   --> Friday of ISO week 4 in 2012
     2012-w04-5    --> Same as above

   Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the
_first_ thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter
([dwmy]) to indicate change in days, weeks, months, or years.  With a
single plus or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a
double plus or minus, it is relative to the default date.  If instead of
a single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date will be
the nth such day.  E.g.,

     +0            --> today
     .             --> today
     +4d           --> four days from today
     +4            --> same as above
     +2w           --> two weeks from today
     ++5           --> five days from default date
     +2tue         --> second Tuesday from now.

   The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use unabbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables `parse-time-months' and `parse-time-weekdays'.

   Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up(2).  When
you exit the date prompt, either by clicking on a date in the calendar,
or by pressing <RET>, the date selected in the calendar will be
combined with the information entered at the prompt.  You can control
the calendar fully from the minibuffer:

     > / <          Scroll calendar forward/backward by one month.
     mouse-1        Select date by clicking on it.
     S-<right>/<left>     One day forward/backward.
     S-<down>/<up>     One week forward/backward.
     M-S-<right>/<left>   One month forward/backward.
     <RET>           Choose date in calendar.

   The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I assure
you they will grow on you, and you will start getting annoyed by pretty
much any other way of entering a date/time out there.  To help you
understand what is going on, the current interpretation of your input
will be displayed live in the minibuffer(3).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-read-date-prefer-future'.

   (2) If you don't need/want the calendar, configure the variable
`org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt'.

   (3) If you find this distracting, turn the display of with
`org-read-date-display-live'.


File: org,  Node: Custom time format,  Prev: The date/time prompt,  Up: Creating timestamps

8.2.2 Custom time format
------------------------

Org mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require another
representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get it by
customizing the variables `org-display-custom-times' and
`org-time-stamp-custom-formats'.

`C-c C-x C-t'
     Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.

Org mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom date/time
format does not _replace_ the default format--instead it is put _over_
the default format using text properties.  This has the following
consequences:
   * You cannot place the cursor onto a timestamp anymore, only before
     or after.

   * The `S-<up>/<down>' keys can no longer be used to adjust each
     component of a timestamp.  If the cursor is at the beginning of
     the stamp, `S-<up>/<down>' will change the stamp by one day, just
     like `S-<left>/<right>'.  At the end of the stamp, the time will
     be changed by one minute.

   * If the timestamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater,
     these will not be overlayed, but remain in the buffer as they were.

   * When you delete a timestamp character-by-character, it will only
     disappear from the buffer after _all_ (invisible) characters
     belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.

   * If the custom timestamp format is longer than the default and you
     are using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If
     the custom format is shorter, things do work as expected.


File: org,  Node: Deadlines and scheduling,  Next: Clocking work time,  Prev: Creating timestamps,  Up: Dates and Times

8.3 Deadlines and scheduling
============================

A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning:

DEADLINE
     Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not
     necessarily) is supposed to be finished on that date.

     On the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda.  In
     addition, the agenda for _today_ will carry a warning about the
     approaching or missed deadline, starting
     `org-deadline-warning-days' before the due date, and continuing
     until the entry is marked DONE.  An example:

          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
              DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>

     You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
     deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a
     warning period of 5 days `DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>'.

SCHEDULED
     Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the
     given date.

     The headline will be listed under the given date(1).  In addition,
     a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present in
     the compilation for _today_, until the entry is marked DONE.  I.e.,

          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>

     Important: Scheduling an item in Org mode should not be understood
     in the same way that we understand scheduling a meeting.  Setting
     a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should mark
     this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown
     on the date where it applies.  This is a frequent misunderstanding
     by Org users.  In Org mode, scheduling means setting a date when
     you want to start working on an action item.

   You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and deadline
entries.  Org mode will issue early and late warnings based on the
assumption that the timestamp represents the nearest instance of the
repeater.  However, the use of diary sexp entries like `<%%(diary-float
t 42)>' in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited.  Org mode
does not know enough about the internals of each sexp function to issue
early and late warnings.  However, it will show the item on each day
where the sexp entry matches.

* Inserting deadline/schedule::  Planning items
* Repeated tasks::              Items that show up again and again

DONE.  If you don't like this, set the variable
`org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done'.


File: org,  Node: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Next: Repeated tasks,  Prev: Deadlines and scheduling,  Up: Deadlines and scheduling

8.3.1 Inserting deadlines or schedules
--------------------------------------

The following commands allow you to quickly insert a deadline or to
schedule an item:

`C-c C-d'
     Insert `DEADLINE' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  When called
     with a prefix arg, an existing deadline will be removed from the
     entry.  

`C-c C-s'
     Insert `SCHEDULED' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED
     timestamp will be removed.  When called with a prefix argument,
     remove the scheduling date from the entry.  

`C-c C-x C-k'
     Mark the current entry for agenda action.  After you have marked
     the entry like this, you can open the agenda or the calendar to
     find an appropriate date.  With the cursor on the selected date,
     press `k s' or `k d' to schedule the marked item.  

`C-c / d'
     Create a sparse tree with all deadlines that are either past-due,
     or which will become due within `org-deadline-warning-days'.  With
     `C-u' prefix, show all deadlines in the file.  With a numeric
     prefix, check that many days.  For example, `C-1 C-c / d' shows
     all deadlines due tomorrow.  

`C-c / b'
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items before a given date.  

`C-c / a'
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items after a given date.


File: org,  Node: Repeated tasks,  Prev: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Up: Deadlines and scheduling

8.3.2 Repeated tasks
--------------------

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE, SCHEDULED,
or plain timestamp.  In the following example
     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>
   the `+1m' is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on <2005-10-01> and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.  If you need both a repeater and a special
warning period in a deadline entry, the repeater should come first and
the warning period last: `DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d>'.

   Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
completed once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a SCHEDULE
with the TODO keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries in the
agenda.  The problem with this is, however, that then also the _next_
instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org mode deals with
this in the following way: When you try to mark such an entry DONE
(using `C-c C-t'), it will shift the base date of the repeating
timestamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the entry state
back to TODO.  In the example above, setting the state to DONE would
actually switch the date like this:

     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>

   A timestamp(1) will be added under the deadline, to keep a record
that you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.

   As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no
longer be visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all
future instances will be visible.

   With the `+1m' cookie, the date shift will always be exactly one
month.  So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this
entry DONE will still keep it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the
task, this may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you
forgot to call you father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call
him 3 times in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks
like changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time after
the last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has special
repeaters markers with `++' and `.+'.  For example:

     ** TODO Call Father
        DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
        but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
        the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
        and marked it done on Saturday.
     ** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
        today.

   You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task--just make sure that the repeater intervals on both are the same.

   An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies
of a task subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command `C-c
C-x c' was created for this purpose, it is described in *note Structure
editing::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can change this using the option `org-log-repeat', or the
`#+STARTUP' options `logrepeat', `lognoterepeat', and `nologrepeat'.
With `lognoterepeat', you will also be prompted for a note.

8.4 Clocking work time
======================

Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.
When you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the
clock is stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It
also computes the total time spent on each subtree of a project.

   Normally, the clock does not survive exiting and re-entering Emacs,
but you can arrange for the clock information to persist across Emacs
sessions with

     (setq org-clock-persist t)
     (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)

`C-c C-x C-i'
     Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the
     CLOCK keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first
     clocking of this item, the multiple CLOCK lines will be wrapped
     into a `:LOGBOOK:' drawer (see also the variable
     `org-clock-into-drawer').  When called with a `C-u' prefix
     argument, select the task from a list of recently clocked tasks.
     With two `C-u C-u' prefixes, clock into the task at point and mark
     it as the default task.  The default task will always be available
     when selecting a clocking task, with letter `d'.
     While the clock is running, the current clocking time is shown in
     the mode line, along with the title of the task.  The clock time
     shown will be all time ever clocked for this task and its
     children.  If the task has an effort estimate (*note Effort
     estimates::), the mode line displays the current clocking time
     against it(1)  If the task is a repeating one (*note Repeated
     tasks::), only the time since the last reset of the task (2) will
     be shown.  More control over what time is shown can be exercised
     with the `CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL' property.  It may have the values
     `current' to show only the current clocking instance, `today' to
     show all time clocked on this tasks today (see also the variable
     `org-extend-today-until'), `all' to include all time, or `auto'
     which is the default(3).
     Clicking with `mouse-1' onto the mode line entry will pop up a
     menu with clocking options.  

`C-c C-x C-o'
     Stop the clock (clock-out).  This inserts another timestamp at the
     same location where the clock was last started.  It also directly
     computes the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as
     `=> HH:MM'.  See the variable `org-log-note-clock-out' for the
     possibility to record an additional note together with the
     clock-out timestamp(4).  

`C-c C-x C-e'
     Update the effort estimate for the current clock task.  

`C-c C-y   or  C-c C-c'
     Recompute the time interval after changing one of the timestamps.
     This is only necessary if you edit the timestamps directly.  If
     you change them with `S-<cursor>' keys, the update is automatic.  

`C-c C-t'
     Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the
     clock if it is running in this same item.  

`C-c C-x C-x'
     Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
     mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.  

`C-c C-x C-j'
     Jump to the entry that contains the currently running clock.  With
     a `C-u' prefix arg, select the target task from a list of recently
     clocked tasks.  

`C-c C-x C-d'
     Display time summaries for each subtree in the current buffer.
     This puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the total
     time recorded under that heading, including the time of any
     subheadings. You can use visibility cycling to study the tree, but
     the overlays disappear when you change the buffer (see variable
     `org-remove-highlights-with-change') or press `C-c C-c'.  

`C-c C-x C-r'
     Insert a dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::) containing a clock
     report as an Org-mode table into the current file.  When the
     cursor is at an existing clock table, just update it.  When called
     with a prefix argument, jump to the first clock report in the
     current document and update it.  
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :scope file
          #+END: clocktable
     If such a block already exists at point, its content is replaced
     by the new table.  The `BEGIN' line can specify options:
          :maxlevel    Maximum level depth to which times are listed in the table.
          :emphasize   When `t', emphasize level one and level two items.
          :scope       The scope to consider.  This can be any of the following:
                       nil        the current buffer or narrowed region
                       file       the full current buffer
                       subtree    the subtree where the clocktable is located
                       treeN      the surrounding level N tree, for example `tree3'
                       tree       the surrounding level 1 tree
                       agenda     all agenda files
                       ("file"..) scan these files
                       file-with-archives    current file and its archives
                       agenda-with-archives  all agenda files, including archives
          :block       The time block to consider.  This block is specified either
                       absolute, or relative to the current time and may be any of
                       these formats:
                       2007-12-31    New year eve 2007
                       2007-12       December 2007

                       thisweek, lastweek, thisweek-N     a relative week
                       thismonth, lastmonth, thismonth-N  a relative month
                       thisyear, lastyear, thisyear-N     a relative year
                       Use `S-<left>/<right>' keys to shift the time interval.
          :tstart      A time string specifying when to start considering times.
          :tend        A time string specifying when to stop considering times.
          :step        `week' or `day', to split the table into chunks.
                       To use this, `:block' or `:tstart', `:tend' are needed.
          :link        Link the item headlines in the table to their origins.
          :formula     Content of a `#+TBLFM' line to be added and evaluated.
                       As a special case, `:formula %' adds a column with % time.
                       If you do not specify a formula here, any existing formula.
                       below the clock table will survive updates and be evaluated.
          :timestamp   A timestamp for the entry, when available.  Look for SCHEDULED,
                       DEADLINE, TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP_IA, in this order.
     To get a clock summary of the current level 1 tree, for the current
     day, you could write
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :block today :scope tree1 :link t
          #+END: clocktable
     and to use a specific time range you could write(5)
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<2006-08-10 Thu 10:00>"
                              :tend "<2006-08-10 Thu 12:00>"
          #+END: clocktable
     A summary of the current subtree with % times would be
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :link t :formula %
          #+END: clocktable
     
`C-c C-c'
`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks in a buffer.  

`S-<left>'
`S-<right>'
     Shift the current `:block' interval and update the table.  The
     cursor needs to be in the `#+BEGIN: clocktable' line for this
     command.  If `:block' is `today', it will be shifted to `today-1'
     etc.

   The `l' key may be used in the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in
the agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::) to show which tasks have been
worked on or closed during a day.

8.5 Effort estimates
====================

If you want to plan your work in a very detailed way, or if you need to
produce offers with quotations of the estimated work effort, you may
want to assign effort estimates to entries.  If you are also clocking
your work, you may later want to compare the planned effort with the
actual working time, a great way to improve planning estimates.  Effort
estimates are stored in a special property `Effort'(1).  You can set
the effort for an entry with the following commands:

`C-c C-x e'
     Set the effort estimate for the current entry.  With a numeric
     prefix argument, set it to the NTH allowed value (see below).
     This command is also accessible from the agenda with the `e' key.  

`C-c C-x C-e'
     Modify the effort estimate of the item currently being clocked.

   Clearly the best way to work with effort estimates is through column
view (*note Column view::).  You should start by setting up discrete
values for effort estimates, and a `COLUMNS' format that displays these
values together with clock sums (if you want to clock your time).  For
a specific buffer you can use

     #+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00
     #+COLUMNS: %40ITEM(Task) %17Effort(Estimated Effort){:} %CLOCKSUM

or, even better, you can set up these values globally by customizing the
variables `org-global-properties' and `org-columns-default-format'.  In
particular if you want to use this setup also in the agenda, a global
setup may be advised.

   The way to assign estimates to individual items is then to switch to
column mode, and to use `S-<right>' and `S-<left>' to change the value.
The values you enter will immediately be summed up in the hierarchy.
In the column next to it, any clocked time will be displayed.

   If you switch to column view in the daily/weekly agenda, the effort
column will summarize the estimated work effort for each day(2), and
you can use this to find space in your schedule.  To get an overview of
the entire part of the day that is committed, you can set the option
`org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum'.  The appointments
on a day that take place over a specified time interval will then also
be added to the load estimate of the day.

   Effort estimates can be used in secondary agenda filtering that is
triggered with the `/' key in the agenda (*note Agenda commands::).  If
you have these estimates defined consistently, two or three key presses
will narrow down the list to stuff that fits into an available time
slot.

`org-effort-property'.

list (*note Agenda column view::).


File: org,  Node: Relative timer,  Prev: Effort estimates,  Up: Dates and Times

8.6 Taking notes with a relative timer
======================================

When taking notes during, for example, a meeting or a video viewing, it
can be useful to have access to times relative to a starting time.  Org
provides such a relative timer and make it easy to create timed notes.

`C-c C-x .'
     Insert a relative time into the buffer.  The first time you use
     this, the timer will be started.  When called with a prefix
     argument, the timer is restarted.  

`C-c C-x -'
     Insert a description list item with the current relative time.
     With a prefix argument, first reset the timer to 0.  

`M-<RET>'
     Once the timer list is started, you can also use `M-<RET>' to
     insert new timer items.  

`C-c C-x ,'
     Pause the timer, or continue it if it is already paused.  

`C-u C-c C-x ,'
     Stop the timer.  After this, you can only start a new timer, not
     continue the old one.  This command also removes the timer from
     the mode line.  

`C-c C-x 0'
     Reset the timer without inserting anything into the buffer.  By
     default, the timer is reset to 0.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix, reset the timer to specific starting offset.  The user is
     prompted for the offset, with a default taken from a timer string
     at point, if any, So this can be used to restart taking notes
     after a break in the process.  When called with a double prefix
     argument `C-c C-u', change all timer strings in the active region
     by a certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer strings if the
     timer was not started at exactly the right moment.

9 Capture
*********

An important part of any organization system is the ability to quickly
capture new ideas and tasks, and to associate reference material with
them.  Org uses the `remember.el' package to create tasks, and stores
files related to a task (attachments) in a special directory.

* Menu:

* Remember::                    Capture new tasks/ideas with little interruption
* Attachments::                 Add files to tasks.

9.1 Remember
============

The Remember package by John Wiegley lets you store quick notes with
little interruption of your work flow.  It is an excellent way to add
new notes and tasks to Org files.  The `remember.el' package is part of
Emacs 23, not Emacs 22.  See
`http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode' for more
information.

   Org significantly expands the possibilities of Remember: you may
define templates for different note types, and associate target files
and headlines with specific templates.  It also allows you to select
the location where a note should be stored interactively, on the fly.

* Menu:

* Setting up Remember for Org::  Some code for .emacs to get things going
* Remember templates::          Define the outline of different note types
* Storing notes::               Directly get the note to where it belongs
* Refiling notes::              Moving a note or task to a project


File: org,  Node: Setting up Remember for Org,  Next: Remember templates,  Prev: Remember,  Up: Remember

9.1.1 Setting up Remember for Org
---------------------------------

The following customization will tell Remember to use Org files as
target, and to create annotations compatible with Org links.

     (org-remember-insinuate)
     (setq org-directory "~/path/to/my/orgfiles/")
     (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
     (define-key global-map "\C-cr" 'org-remember)

The last line binds the command `org-remember' to a global key(1).
`org-remember' basically just calls Remember, but it makes a few things
easier: if there is an active region, it will automatically copy the
region into the Remember buffer.  It also allows to jump to the buffer
and location where Remember notes are being stored: just call
`org-remember' with a prefix argument.  If you use two prefix
arguments, Org jumps to the location where the last remember note was
stored.

   The Remember buffer will actually use `org-mode' as its major mode,
so that all editing features of Org mode are available.  In addition to
this, a minor mode `org-remember-mode' is turned on, for the single
purpose that you can use its keymap `org-remember-mode-map' to
overwrite some of Org mode's key bindings.

   You can also call `org-remember' in a special way from the agenda,
using the `k r' key combination.  With this access, any timestamps
inserted by the selected Remember template (see below) will default to
the cursor date in the agenda, rather than to the current date.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Please select your own key, `C-c r' is only a suggestion.


File: org,  Node: Remember templates,  Next: Storing notes,  Prev: Setting up Remember for Org,  Up: Remember

9.1.2 Remember templates
------------------------

In combination with Org, you can use templates to generate different
types of Remember notes.  For example, if you would like to use one
template to create general TODO entries, another one for journal
entries, and a third one for collecting random ideas, you could use:

     (setq org-remember-templates
      '(("Todo" ?t "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/TODO.org" "Tasks")
        ("Journal" ?j "* %U %?\n\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org")
        ("Idea" ?i "* %^{Title}\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "New Ideas")))

In these entries, the first string is just a name, and the character
specifies how to select the template.  It is useful if the character is
also the first letter of the name.  The next string specifies the
template.  Two more (optional) strings give the file in which, and the
headline under which, the new note should be stored.  The file (if not
present or `nil') defaults to `org-default-notes-file', the heading to
`org-remember-default-headline'.  If the file name is not an absolute
path, it will be interpreted relative to `org-directory'.  The heading
can also be the symbols `top' or `bottom' to send notes as level 1
entries to the beginning or end of the file, respectively.

   An optional sixth element specifies the contexts in which the user
can select the template.  This element can be a list of major modes or
a function.  `org-remember' will first check whether the function
returns `t' or if we are in any of the listed major modes, and exclude
templates for which this condition is not fulfilled.  Templates that do
not specify this element at all, or that use `nil' or `t' as a value
will always be selectable.

   So for example:

     (setq org-remember-templates
      '(("Bug" ?b "* BUG %?\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/BUGS.org" "Bugs" (emacs-lisp-mode))
        ("Journal" ?j "* %U %?\n\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "X" my-check)
        ("Idea" ?i "* %^{Title}\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "New Ideas")))

The first template will only be available when invoking `org-remember'
from an buffer in `emacs-lisp-mode'.  The second template will only be
available when the function `my-check' returns `t'.  The third template
will be proposed in any context.

   When you call `M-x org-remember' (or `M-x remember') to remember
something, Org will prompt for a key to select the template (if you have
more than one template) and then prepare the buffer like
     * TODO
       [[file:LINK TO WHERE YOU CALLED REMEMBER]]

During expansion of the template, special `%'-escapes(1) allow dynamic
insertion of content:
     %^{PROMPT}  prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
                 You may specify a default value and a completion table with
                 %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...}
                 The arrow keys access a prompt-specific history.
     %a          annotation, normally the link created with `org-store-link'
     %A          like `%a', but prompt for the description part
     %i          initial content, the region when remember is called with C-u.
                 The entire text will be indented like `%i' itself.
     %t          timestamp, date only
     %T          timestamp with date and time
     %u, %U      like the above, but inactive timestamps
     %^t         like `%t', but prompt for date.  Similarly `%^T', `%^u', `%^U'
                 You may define a prompt like `%^{Birthday}t'
     %n          user name (taken from `user-full-name')
     %c          Current kill ring head.
     %x          Content of the X clipboard.
     %^C         Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
     %^L         Like `%^C', but insert as link.
     %^g         prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
     %k          title of currently clocked task
     %K          link to currently clocked task
     %^G         prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.

To place the cursor after template expansion use:

If you change your mind about which template to use, call
`org-remember' in the remember buffer.  You may then select a new
template that will be filled with the previous context information.

9.1.3 Storing notes
-------------------

When you are finished preparing a note with Remember, you have to press
`C-c C-c' to file the note away.  If you have started the clock in the
Remember buffer, you will first be asked if you want to clock out
now(1).  If you answer `n', the clock will continue to run after the
note was filed away.

   The handler will then store the note in the file and under the
headline specified in the template, or it will use the default file and
headline.  The window configuration will be restored, sending you back
to the working context before the call to Remember.  To re-use the
location found during the last call to Remember, exit the Remember
buffer with `C-0 C-c C-c', i.e., Another special case is `C-2 C-c C-c'
which files the note as a child of the currently clocked item.

   If you want to store the note directly to a different place, use
`C-1 C-c C-c' instead to exit Remember(2).  The handler will then first
prompt for a target file--if you press <RET>, the value specified for
the template is used.  Then the command offers the headings tree of the
selected file, with the cursor position at the default headline (if you
specified one in the template).  You can either immediately press <RET>
to get the note placed there.  Or you can use the following keys to
find a different location:
     <TAB>         Cycle visibility.
     <down> / <up>   Next/previous visible headline.
     n / p        Next/previous visible headline.
     f / b        Next/previous headline same level.
     u            One level up.
   Pressing <RET> or <left> or <right> then leads to the following
result.

Cursor         Key         Note gets inserted
position                   
on headline    <RET>       as sublevel of the heading at cursor, first or
                           last
                           depending on `org-reverse-note-order'.
               <left>/<right>as same level, before/after current heading

                           depending on `org-reverse-note-order'.
not on         <RET>       at cursor position, level taken from context.
headline                   

   Before inserting the text into a tree, the function ensures that the
text has a headline, i.e., headline is constructed from the current
date.  If you have indented the text of the note below the headline,
the indentation will be adapted if inserting the note into the tree
requires demotion from level 1.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To avoid this query, configure the variable
`org-remember-clock-out-on-exit'.

   (2) Configure the variable `org-remember-store-without-prompt' to
make this behavior the default.


File: org,  Node: Refiling notes,  Prev: Storing notes,  Up: Remember

9.1.4 Refiling notes
--------------------

Remember is usually used to quickly capture notes and tasks into one or
a few capture lists.  When reviewing the captured data, you may want to
refile some of the entries into a different list, for example into a
project.  Cutting, finding the right location, and then pasting the note
is cumbersome.  To simplify this process, you can use the following
special command:

`C-c C-w'
     Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible
     locations for refiling the entry and lets you select one with
     completion.  The item (or all items in the region) is filed below
     the target heading as a subitem.  Depending on
     `org-reverse-note-order', it will be either the first or last
     subitem.
     By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are
     considered to be targets, but you can have more complex
     definitions across a number of files.  See the variable
     `org-refile-targets' for details.  If you would like to select a
     location via a file-path-like completion along the outline path,
     see the variables `org-refile-use-outline-path' and
     `org-outline-path-complete-in-steps'.  If you would like to be
     able to create new nodes as new parents for for refiling on the
     fly, check the variable `org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes'.  

`C-u C-c C-w'
     Use the refile interface to jump to a heading.  

`C-u C-u C-c C-w'
     Jump to the location where `org-refile' last moved a tree to.


File: org,  Node: Attachments,  Next: RSS Feeds,  Prev: Remember,  Up: Capture

9.2 Attachments
===============

It is often useful to associate reference material with an outline
node/task.  Small chunks of plain text can simply be stored in the
subtree of a project.  Hyperlinks (*note Hyperlinks::) can be used to
establish associations with files that live elsewhere on your computer
or in the cloud, like emails or source code files belonging to a
project.  Another method is attachments, which are files located in a
directory belonging to an outline node.  Org uses directories named by
the unique ID of each entry.  These directories are located in the
`data' directory which lives in the same directory where your Org file
lives(1).  If you initialize this directory with `git init', Org will
automatically commit changes when it sees them.  The attachment system
has been contributed to Org by John Wiegley.

   In cases where it seems better to do so, you can also attach a
directory of your choice to an entry.  You can also make children
inherit the attachment directory from a parent, so that an entire
subtree uses the same attached directory.

The following commands deal with attachments.

`C-c C-a'
     The dispatcher for commands related to the attachment system.
     After these keys, a list of commands is displayed and you need to
     press an additional key to select a command:

    `a'
          Select a file and move it into the task's attachment
          directory.  The file will be copied, moved, or linked,
          depending on `org-attach-method'.  Note that hard links are
          not supported on all systems.

    `c/m/l'
          Attach a file using the copy/move/link method.  Note that
          hard links are not supported on all systems.

    `n'
          Create a new attachment as an Emacs buffer.

    `z'
          Synchronize the current task with its attachment directory,
          in case you added attachments yourself.

    `o'
          Open current task's attachment.  If there are more than one,
          prompt for a file name first.  Opening will follow the rules
          set by `org-file-apps'.  For more details, see the
          information on following hyperlinks (*note Handling links::).

    `O'
          Also open the attachment, but force opening the file in Emacs.

    `f'
          Open the current task's attachment directory.

    `F'
          Also open the directory, but force using `dired' in Emacs.

    `d'
          Select and delete a single attachment.

    `D'
          Delete all of a task's attachments.  A safer way is to open
          the directory in `dired' and delete from there.

    `C-c C-a s'
          Set a specific directory as the entry's attachment directory.
          This works by putting the directory path into the
          `ATTACH_DIR' property.

    `C-c C-a i'
          Set the `ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT' property, so that children will
          use the same directory for attachments as the parent does.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you move entries or Org files from one directory to another,
you may want to configure `org-attach-directory' to contain an absolute
path.


File: org,  Node: RSS Feeds,  Next: Protocols,  Prev: Attachments,  Up: Capture

9.3 RSS feeds
=============

Org has the capability to add and change entries based on information
found in RSS feeds.  You could use this to make a task out of each new
podcast in a podcast feed.  Or you could use a phone-based
note-creating service on the web to import tasks into Org.  To access
feeds, you need to configure the variable `org-feed-alist'.  The
docstring of this variable has detailed information.  Here is just an
example:

     (setq org-feed-alist
           '(("ReQall" "http://www.reqall.com/user/feeds/rss/a1b2c3....."
              "~/org/feeds.org" "ReQall Entries")
   will configure that new items from the feed provided by `reqall.com'
will result in new entries in the file `~/org/feeds.org' under the
heading `ReQall Entries', whenever the following command is used:

`C-c C-x g'
     Collect items from the feeds configured in `org-feed-alist' and
     act upon them.  

`C-c C-x G'
     Prompt for a feed name and go to the inbox configured for this
     feed.

   Under the same headline, Org will create a drawer `FEEDSTATUS' in
which it will store information about the status of items in the feed,
to avoid adding the same item several times.  You should add
`FEEDSTATUS' to the list of drawers in that file:

     #+DRAWERS: LOGBOOK PROPERTIES FEEDSTATUS

   For more information, see `org-feed.el' and the docstring of
`org-feed-alist'.


File: org,  Node: Protocols,  Prev: RSS Feeds,  Up: Capture

9.4 Protocols for external access
=================================

You can set up Org for handling protocol calls from outside
applications that are passed to Emacs through the `emacsserver'.  For
example, you can configure bookmarks in your web browser to send a link
to the current page to Org and create a note from it using Remember
(*note Remember::).  Or you could create a bookmark that will tell
Emacs to open the local source file of a remote website you are looking
at with the browser.  See
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php' for detailed
documentation and setup instructions.


File: org,  Node: Agenda Views,  Next: Embedded LaTeX,  Prev: Capture,  Up: Top

10 Agenda Views
***************

Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged
headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of files.
To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are
important for a particular date, this information must be collected,
sorted and displayed in an organized way.

   Org can select items based on various criteria and display them in a
separate buffer.  Seven different view types are provided:

   * an _agenda_ that is like a calendar and shows information for
     specific dates,

   * a _TODO list_ that covers all unfinished action items,

   * a _match view_, showings headlines based on the tags, properties,
     and TODO state associated with them,

   * a _timeline view_ that shows all events in a single Org file, in
     time-sorted view,

   * a _keyword search view_ that shows all entries from multiple files
     that contain specified keywords,

   * a _stuck projects view_ showing projects that currently don't move
     along, and

   * _custom views_ that are special tag/keyword searches and
     combinations of different views.

The extracted information is displayed in a special _agenda buffer_.
This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org files, and even to edit
these files remotely.

   Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether
the window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
`org-agenda-window-setup' and `org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit'.

* Menu:

* Agenda files::                Files being searched for agenda information
* Agenda dispatcher::           Keyboard access to agenda views
* Built-in agenda views::       What is available out of the box?
* Presentation and sorting::    How agenda items are prepared for display
* Agenda commands::             Remote editing of Org trees
* Custom agenda views::         Defining special searches and views
* Exporting Agenda Views::      Writing a view to a file
* Agenda column view::          Using column view for collected entries


File: org,  Node: Agenda files,  Next: Agenda dispatcher,  Prev: Agenda Views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.1 Agenda files
=================

The information to be shown is normally collected from all _agenda
files_, the files listed in the variable `org-agenda-files'(1). If a
directory is part of this list, all files with the extension `.org' in
this directory will be part of the list.

   Thus, even if you only work with a single Org file, that file should
be put into the list(2).  You can customize `org-agenda-files', but the
easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

`C-c ['
     Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
     the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved
     to the front.  With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the
     end.  

`C-c ]'
     Remove current file from the list of agenda files.  

`C-,'
`C-''
     Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.  

`M-x org-iswitchb'
     Command to use an `iswitchb'-like interface to switch to and
     between Org buffers.

The Org menu contains the current list of files and can be used to
visit any of them.

   If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily on a file not in
this list, or on just one file in the list, or even on only a subtree
in a file, then this can be done in different ways.  For a single
agenda command, you may press `<' once or several times in the
dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::).  To restrict the agenda scope
for an extended period, use the following commands:

`C-c C-x <'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  When with
     a prefix argument, or with the cursor before the first headline in
     a file, the agenda scope is set to the entire file.  This
     restriction remains in effect until removed with `C-c C-x >', or
     by typing either `<' or `>' in the agenda dispatcher.  If there is
     a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes
     effect immediately.  

`C-c C-x >'
     Remove the permanent restriction created by `C-c C-x <'.

When working with `speedbar.el', you can use the following commands in
the Speedbar frame:
`< in the speedbar frame'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the item--either an Org file or
     a subtree in such a file--at the cursor in the Speedbar frame.  If
     there is a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction
     takes effect immediately.  

`> in the speedbar frame'
     Lift the restriction.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the value of that variable is not a list, but a single file
name, then the list of agenda files will be maintained in that external
file.

   (2) When using the dispatcher, pressing `<' before selecting a
command will actually limit the command to the current file, and ignore
`org-agenda-files' until the next dispatcher command.


File: org,  Node: Agenda dispatcher,  Next: Built-in agenda views,  Prev: Agenda files,  Up: Agenda Views

10.2 The agenda dispatcher
==========================

The views are created through a dispatcher, which should be bound to a
global key--for example `C-c a' (*note Installation::).  In the
following we will assume that `C-c a' is indeed how the dispatcher is
accessed and list keyboard access to commands accordingly.  After
pressing `C-c a', an additional letter is required to execute a
command.  The dispatcher offers the following default commands:
`a'
     Create the calendar-like agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).

`t / T'
     Create a list of all TODO items (*note Global TODO list::).

`m / M'
     Create a list of headlines matching a TAGS expression (*note
     Matching tags and properties::).

`L'
     Create the timeline view for the current buffer (*note Timeline::).

`s'
     Create a list of entries selected by a boolean expression of
     keywords and/or regular expressions that must or must not occur in
     the entry.

`/'
     Search for a regular expression in all agenda files and
     additionally in the files listed in
     `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.  This uses the Emacs command
     `multi-occur'.  A prefix argument can be used to specify the
     number of context lines for each match, default is 1.

`# / !'
     Create a list of stuck projects (*note Stuck projects::).

`<'
     Restrict an agenda command to the current buffer(1).  After
     pressing `<', you still need to press the character selecting the
     command.

`< <'
     If there is an active region, restrict the following agenda
     command to the region.  Otherwise, restrict it to the current
     subtree(2).  After pressing `< <', you still need to press the
     character selecting the command.

   You can also define custom commands that will be accessible through
the dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list and
a number of special tags matches.  *Note Custom agenda views::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, you can also press `1' to restrict
to the current buffer.

   (2) For backward compatibility, you can also press `0' to restrict
to the current region/subtree.

File: org,  Node: Weekly/daily agenda,  Next: Global TODO list,  Prev: Built-in agenda views,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.1 The weekly/daily agenda
------------------------------

The purpose of the weekly/daily _agenda_ is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

`C-c a a'
     Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.
     The agenda shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric
     prefix(1)  (like `C-u 2 1 C-c a a') you may set the number of days
     to be displayed (see also the variable `org-agenda-ndays')

   Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you
can change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda
buffer.  The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in
*note Agenda commands::.

Calendar/Diary integration
..........................

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org with the diary.

   In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

     (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)

After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary entries
including holidays, anniversaries, etc., will be included in the agenda
buffer created by Org mode.  <SPC>, <TAB>, and <RET> can be used from
the agenda buffer to jump to the diary file in order to edit existing
diary entries.  The `i' command to insert new entries for the current
date works in the agenda buffer, as well as the commands `S', `M', and
`C' to display Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert
to other calendars, respectively.  `c' can be used to switch back and
forth between calendar and agenda.

   If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org file. Org mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no whitespace is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org file will be processed and entries will
be made in the agenda:

     * Birthdays and similar stuff
     #+CATEGORY: Holiday
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
     #+CATEGORY: Ann
     %%(diary-anniversary 14  5 1956) Arthur Dent is %d years old
     %%(diary-anniversary  2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old

Anniversaries from BBDB
.......................

If you are using the Big Brothers Database to store your contacts, you
will very likely prefer to store anniversaries in BBDB rather than in a
separate Org or diary file.  Org supports this and will show BBDB
anniversaries as part of the agenda.  All you need to do is to add the
following to one your your agenda files:

     * Anniversaries
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Anniv
       :END
     %%(org-bbdb-anniversaries)

   You can then go ahead and define anniversaries for a BBDB record.
Basically, you need to press `C-o anniversary <RET>' with the cursor in
a BBDB record and then add the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD',
followed by a space and the class of the anniversary (`birthday' or
`wedding', or a format string).  If you omit the class, it will default
to `birthday'.  Here are a few examples, the header for the file
`org-bbdb.el' contains more detailed information.

     1973-06-22
     1955-08-02 wedding
     2008-04-14 %s released version 6.01 of org-mode, %d years ago

   After a change to BBDB, or for the first agenda display during an
Emacs session, the agenda display will suffer a short delay as Org
updates its hash with anniversaries.  However, from then on things will
be very fast--much faster in fact than a long list of
`%%(diary-anniversary)' entries in an Org or Diary file.

Appointment reminders
.....................

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To add
all the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
`org-agenda-to-appt'.  This command also lets you filter through the
list of your appointments and add only those belonging to a specific
category or matching a regular expression. See the docstring for
details.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the universal prefix `C-u' causes
all TODO entries to be listed before the agenda.  This feature is
deprecated, use the dedicated TODO list, or a block agenda instead
(*note Block agenda::).


File: org,  Node: Global TODO list,  Next: Matching tags and properties,  Prev: Weekly/daily agenda,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.2 The global TODO list
---------------------------

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items formatted and
collected into a single place.

`C-c a t'
     Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
     agenda files (*note Agenda Views::) into a single buffer.  The
     buffer is in `agenda-mode', so there are commands to examine and
     manipulate the TODO entries directly from that buffer (*note
     Agenda commands::).  

`C-c a T'
     Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.
     You can also do this by specifying a prefix argument to `C-c a t'.
     With a `C-u' prefix you are prompted for a keyword, and you may
     also specify several keywords by separating them with `|' as the
     boolean OR operator.  With a numeric prefix, the nth keyword in
     `org-todo-keywords' is selected.  The `r' key in the agenda buffer
     regenerates it, and you can give a prefix argument to this command
     to change the selected TODO keyword, for example `3 r'.  If you
     often need a search for a specific keyword, define a custom
     command for it (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
     Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
     search (*note Tag searches::).

   Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the TODO
list are described in *note Agenda commands::.

   Normally the global TODO list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:
   - Some people view a TODO item that has been _scheduled_ for
     execution or have a _deadline_ (*note Timestamps::) as no longer
     _open_.  Configure the variables
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled',
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines', and/or
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date' to exclude such items from the
     global TODO list.

   - TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.
     In such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO
     headline and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure
     the variable `org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels' to get this behavior.

10.3.3 Matching tags and properties
-----------------------------------

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with _tags_ (*note Tags::),
or have properties (*note Properties and Columns::), you can select
headlines based on this metadata and collect them into an agenda
buffer.  The match syntax described here also applies when creating
sparse trees with `C-c / m'.

`C-c a m'
     Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.
     The command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean
     logic expression with tags, like `+work+urgent-withboss' or
     `work|home' (*note Tags::).  If you often need a specific search,
     define a custom command for it (*note Agenda dispatcher::).  

`C-c a M'
     Like `C-c a m', but only select headlines that are also TODO items
     and force checking subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').  To exclude scheduled/deadline
     items, see the variable
     `org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options'.  Matching specific
     TODO keywords together with a tags match is also possible, see
     *note Tag searches::.

   The commands available in the tags list are described in *note
Agenda commands::.

Match syntax
............

A search string can use Boolean operators `&' for AND and `|' for OR.
`&' binds more strongly than `|'.  Parentheses are currently not
implemented.  Each element in the search is either a tag, a regular
expression matching tags, or an expression like `PROPERTY OPERATOR
VALUE' with a comparison operator, accessing a property value.  Each
element may be preceded by `-', to select against it, and `+' is
syntactic sugar for positive selection.  The AND operator `&' is
optional when `+' or `-' is present.  Here are some examples, using
only tags.

`+work-boss'
     Select headlines tagged `:work:', but discard those also tagged
     `:boss:'.

`work|laptop'
     Selects lines tagged `:work:' or `:laptop:'.

`work|laptop+night'
     Like before, but require the `:laptop:' lines to be tagged also
     `:night:'.

   Instead of a tag, you may also specify a regular expression enclosed
in curly braces.  For example, `work+{^boss.*}' matches headlines that
contain the tag `:work:' and any tag starting with `boss'.

   You may also test for properties (*note Properties and Columns::) at
the same time as matching tags.  The properties may be real properties,
or special properties that represent other metadata (*note Special
properties::).  For example, the "property" `TODO' represents the TODO
keyword of the entry.  Or, the "property" `LEVEL' represents the level
of an entry.  So a search `+LEVEL=3+boss-TODO="DONE"' lists all level
three headlines that have the tag `boss' and are _not_ marked with the
TODO keyword DONE.  In buffers with `org-odd-levels-only' set, `LEVEL'
does not count the number of stars, but `LEVEL=2' will correspond to 3
stars etc.

   Here are more examples:
`work+TODO="WAITING"'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO keyword
     `WAITING'.

`work+TODO="WAITING"|home+TODO="WAITING"'
     Waiting tasks both at work and at home.

   When matching properties, a number of different operators can be
used to test the value of a property.  Here is a complex example:

     +work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+Effort<2         \
              +With={Sarah\|Denny}+SCHEDULED>="<2008-10-11>"

The type of comparison will depend on how the comparison value is
written:
   - If the comparison value is a plain number, a numerical comparison
     is done, and the allowed operators are `<', `=', `>', `<=', `>=',
     and `<>'.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes, a string
     comparison is done, and the same operators are allowed.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes _and_ angular
     brackets (like `DEADLINE<="<2008-12-24 18:30>"'), both values are
     assumed to be date/time specifications in the standard Org way,
     and the comparison will be done accordingly.  Special values that
     will be recognized are `"<now>"' for now (including time), and
     `"<today>"', and `"<tomorrow>"' for these days at 0:00 hours, i.e.,
     specification.  Also strings like `"<+5d>"' or `"<-2m>"' with units
     `d', `w', `m', and `y' for day, week, month, and year,
     respectively, can be used.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in curly braces, a regexp
     match is performed, with `=' meaning that the regexp matches the
     property value, and `<>' meaning that it does not match.

   So the search string in the example finds entries tagged `:work:' but
not `:boss:', which also have a priority value `A', a `:Coffee:'
property with the value `unlimited', an `Effort' property that is
numerically smaller than 2, a `:With:' property that is matched by the
regular expression `Sarah\|Denny', and that are scheduled on or after
October 11, 2008.

   Accessing TODO, LEVEL, and CATEGORY during a search is fast.
Accessing any other properties will slow down the search.  However,
once you have paid the price by accessing one property, testing
additional properties is cheap again.

   You can configure Org mode to use property inheritance during a
search, but beware that this can slow down searches considerably.  See
*note Property inheritance::, for details.

   For backward compatibility, and also for typing speed, there is also
a different way to test TODO states in a search.  For this, terminate
the tags/property part of the search string (which may include several
terms connected with `|') with a `/' and then specify a Boolean
expression just for TODO keywords.  The syntax is then similar to that
for tags, but should be applied with care: for example, a positive
selection on several TODO keywords cannot meaningfully be combined with
boolean AND.  However, _negative selection_ combined with AND can be
meaningful.  To make sure that only lines are checked that actually
have any TODO keyword (resulting in a speed-up), use `C-c a M', or
equivalently start the TODO part after the slash with `!'.  Examples:

`work/WAITING'
     Same as `work+TODO="WAITING"'

`work/!-WAITING-NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are neither `WAITING' nor
     `NEXT'

`work/!+WAITING|+NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are either `WAITING' or
     `NEXT'.

10.3.4 Timeline for a single file
---------------------------------

The timeline summarizes all time-stamped items from a single Org mode
file in a _time-sorted view_.  The main purpose of this command is to
give an overview over events in a project.

`C-c a L'
     Show a time-sorted view of the Org file, with all time-stamped
     items.  When called with a `C-u' prefix, all unfinished TODO
     entries (scheduled or not) are also listed under the current date.

The commands available in the timeline buffer are listed in *note
Agenda commands::.


File: org,  Node: Keyword search,  Next: Stuck projects,  Prev: Timeline,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.5 Keyword search
---------------------

This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries.
It is particularly useful to find notes.

`C-c a s'
     This is a special search that lets you select entries by keywords
     or regular expression, using a boolean logic.  For example, the
     search string

          +computer +wifi -ethernet -{8\.11[bg]}

     will search for note entries that contain the keywords `computer'
     and `wifi', but not the keyword `ethernet', and which are also not
     matched by the regular expression `8\.11[bg]', meaning to exclude
     both 8.11b and 8.11g.

     Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command will also
     search the files listed in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.


File: org,  Node: Stuck projects,  Prev: Keyword search,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.6 Stuck projects
---------------------

If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the "duties" you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A _stuck_ project is a project that has
no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists Org
mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such projects
and define next actions for them.

`C-c a #'
     List projects that are stuck.  

`C-c a !'
     Customize the variable `org-stuck-projects' to define what a stuck
     project is and how to find it.

   You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a TODO keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

   Let's assume that you, in your own way of using Org mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a TODO keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Let's further
assume that the TODO keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that NEXT
and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @SHOP indicates shopping and
is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the project
contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed
either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible projects
with a tags/todo match(1) `+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE', and then check for
TODO, NEXT, @SHOP, and IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that
are not stuck.  The correct customization for this is

     (setq org-stuck-projects
           '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@SHOP")
                                    "\\<IGNORE\\>"))

   Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree of
this entry will still be searched for stuck projects.

10.4 Presentation and sorting
=============================

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org mode visually prepares
the items and sorts them.  Each item occupies a single line.  The line
starts with a _prefix_ that contains the _category_ (*note
Categories::) of the item and other important information.  You can
customize the prefix using the option `org-agenda-prefix-format'.  The
prefix is followed by a cleaned-up version of the outline headline
associated with the item.

* Menu:

* Categories::                  Not all tasks are equal
* Time-of-day specifications::  How the agenda knows the time
* Sorting of agenda items::     The order of things


File: org,  Node: Categories,  Next: Time-of-day specifications,  Prev: Presentation and sorting,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.1 Categories
-----------------

The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default,
the category is simply derived from the file name, but you can also
specify it with a special line in the buffer, like this(1):

     #+CATEGORY: Thesis

If you would like to have a special CATEGORY for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a `:CATEGORY:' property with the special
category you want to apply as the value.

The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the category is not
longer than 10 characters.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: if there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the category for the
text below it.  The first category also applies to any text before the
first CATEGORY line.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple categories in a
buffer is using a property.


File: org,  Node: Time-of-day specifications,  Next: Sorting of agenda items,  Prev: Categories,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.2 Time-of-day specifications
---------------------------------

Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example as in `<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>'.  Time ranges can be
specified with two timestamps, like
`<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>'.

   In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range) may also appear as
plain text (like `12:45' or a `8:30-1pm').  If the agenda integrates
the Emacs diary (*note Weekly/daily agenda::), time specifications in
diary entries are recognized as well.

   For agenda display, Org mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in
the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

         8:00...... ------------------
         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        10:00...... ------------------
        12:00...... ------------------
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        14:00...... ------------------
        16:00...... ------------------
        18:00...... ------------------
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:00...... ------------------
        20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   The time grid can be turned on and off with the variable
`org-agenda-use-time-grid', and can be configured with
`org-agenda-time-grid'.


File: org,  Node: Sorting of agenda items,  Prev: Time-of-day specifications,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.3 Sorting of agenda items
------------------------------

Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.
   * For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.
     The default order is to first collect all items containing an
     explicit time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown
     at the beginning of the list, as a _schedule_ for the day.  After
     that, items remain grouped in categories, in the sequence given by
     `org-agenda-files'.  Within each category, items are sorted by
     priority (*note Priorities::), which is composed of the base
     priority (2000 for priority `A', 1000 for `B', and 0 for `C'),
     plus additional increments for overdue scheduled or deadline items.

   * For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but
     within each category, sorting takes place according to priority
     (*note Priorities::).  The priority used for sorting derives from
     the priority cookie, with additions depending on how close an item
     is to its due or scheduled date.

   * For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in
     the sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.

   Sorting can be customized using the variable
`org-agenda-sorting-strategy', and may also include criteria based on
the estimated effort of an entry (*note Effort estimates::).

10.5 Commands in the agenda buffer
==================================

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the Org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the Org files "remotely" from the
agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

   Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, the cursor needs to be in the desired line.

Motion
......

`n'
     Next line (same as <up> and `C-p').  

`p'
     Previous line (same as <down> and `C-n').

View/Go to Org file
...................

`mouse-3'
`<SPC>'
     Display the original location of the item in another window.  With
     prefix arg, make sure that the entire entry is made visible in the
     outline, not only the heading.  

`L'
     Display original location and recenter that window.  

`mouse-2'
`mouse-1'
`<TAB>'
     Go to the original location of the item in another window.  Under
     Emacs 22, `mouse-1' will also works for this.  

`<RET>'
     Go to the original location of the item and delete other windows.  

`F'
     Toggle Follow mode.  In Follow mode, as you move the cursor through
     the agenda buffer, the other window always shows the corresponding
     location in the Org file.  The initial setting for this mode in new
     agenda buffers can be set with the variable
     `org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode'.  

`C-c C-x b'
     Display the entire subtree of the current item in an indirect
     buffer.  With a numeric prefix argument N, go up to level N and
     then take that tree.  If N is negative, go up that many levels.
     With a `C-u' prefix, do not remove the previously used indirect
     buffer.

`C-c C-o'
     Follow a link in the entry.  This will offer a selection of any
     links in the text belonging to the referenced Org node.  If there
     is only one link, it will be followed without a selection prompt.

Change display
..............

`o'
     Delete other windows.  

`v d  or short  d'
`v w  or short  w'
`v m'
`v y'
     Switch to day/week/month/year view.  When switching to day or week
     view, this setting becomes the default for subsequent agenda
     commands.  Since month and year views are slow to create, they do
     not become the default.  A numeric prefix argument may be used to
     jump directly to a specific day of the year, ISO week, month, or
     year, respectively.  For example, `32 d' jumps to February 1st, `9
     w' to ISO week number 9.  When setting day, week, or month view, a
     year may be encoded in the prefix argument as well.  For example,
     `200712 w' will jump to week 12 in 2007.  If such a year
     specification has only one or two digits, it will be mapped to the
     interval 1938-2037.  

`f'
     Go forward in time to display the following `org-agenda-ndays'
     days.  For example, if the display covers a week, switch to the
     following week.  With prefix arg, go forward that many times
     `org-agenda-ndays' days.  

`b'
     Go backward in time to display earlier dates.  

`.'
     Go to today.  

`j'
     Prompt for a date and go there.  

`D'
     Toggle the inclusion of diary entries.  See *note Weekly/daily
     agenda::.  

`v l  or short  l'
     Toggle Logbook mode.  In Logbook mode, entries that were marked
     DONE while logging was on (variable `org-log-done') are shown in
     the agenda, as are entries that have been clocked on that day.
     You can configure the entry types that should be included in log
     mode using the variable `org-agenda-log-mode-items'.  When called
     with a `C-u' prefix, show all possible logbook entries, including
     state changes.  When called with two prefix args `C-u C-u', show
     only logging information, nothing else.  

`v [  or short  ['
     Include inactive timestamps into the current view.  Only for
     weekly/daily agenda and timeline views.  

`v a'
`v A'
     Toggle Archives mode.  In Archives mode, trees that are marked
     `ARCHIVED' are also scanned when producing the agenda.  When you
     use the capital `A', even all archive files are included.  To exit
     archives mode, press `v a' again.  

`v R  or short  R'
     Toggle Clockreport mode.  In Clockreport mode, the daily/weekly
     agenda will always show a table with the clocked times for the
     timespan and file scope covered by the current agenda view.  The
     initial setting for this mode in new agenda buffers can be set
     with the variable `org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode'.  

`v E  or short  E'
     Toggle entry text mode.  In entry text mode, a number of lines
     from the Org outline node referenced by an agenda line will be
     displayed below the line.  The maximum number of lines is given by
     the variable `org-agenda-entry-text-maxlines'.  Calling this
     command with a numeric prefix argument will temporarily modify
     that number to the prefix value.  

`G'
     Toggle the time grid on and off.  See also the variables
     `org-agenda-use-time-grid' and `org-agenda-time-grid'.  

`r'
     Recreate the agenda buffer, for example to reflect the changes
     after modification of the timestamps of items with `S-<left>' and
     `S-<right>'.  When the buffer is the global TODO list, a prefix
     argument is interpreted to create a selective list for a specific
     TODO keyword.  

`g'
     Same as `r'.  

`s'
`C-x C-s'
     Save all Org buffers in the current Emacs session, and also the
     locations of IDs.  

`C-c C-x C-c'
     Invoke column view (*note Column view::) in the agenda buffer.
     The column view format is taken from the entry at point, or (if
     there is no entry at point), from the first entry in the agenda
     view.  So whatever the format for that entry would be in the
     original buffer (taken from a property, from a `#+COLUMNS' line,
     or from the default variable `org-columns-default-format'), will
     be used in the agenda.

`C-c C-x >'
     Remove the restriction lock on the agenda, if it is currently
     restricted to a file or subtree (*note Agenda files::).

Secondary filtering and query editing
.....................................

`/'
     Filter the current agenda view with respect to a tag and/or effort
     estimates.  The difference between this and a custom agenda
     command is that filtering is very fast, so that you can switch
     quickly between different filters without having to recreate the
     agenda(1)

     You will be prompted for a tag selection letter.  Pressing <TAB>
     at that prompt will offer use completion to select a tag
     (including any tags that do not have a selection character).  The
     command then hides all entries that do not contain or inherit this
     tag.  When called with prefix arg, remove the entries that _do_
     have the tag.  A second `/' at the prompt will turn off the filter
     and unhide any hidden entries.  If the first key you press is
     either `+' or `-', the previous filter will be narrowed by
     requiring or forbidding the selected additional tag.  Instead of
     pressing `+' or `-' after `/', you can also immediately use the `\'
     command.

     In order to filter for effort estimates, you should set-up allowed
     efforts globally, for example
          (setq org-global-properties
              '(("Effort_ALL". "0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00")))
     You can then filter for an effort by first typing an operator, one
     of `<', `>', and `=', and then the one-digit index of an effort
     estimate in your array of allowed values, where `0' means the 10th
     value.  The filter will then restrict to entries with effort
     smaller-or-equal, equal, or larger-or-equal than the selected
     value.  If the digits 0-9 are not used as fast access keys to
     tags, you can also simply press the index digit directly without
     an operator.  In this case, `<' will be assumed.  For application
     of the operator, entries without a defined effort will be treated
     according to the value of `org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high'.  To
     filter for tasks without effort definition, press `?' as the
     operator.

`\'
     Narrow the current agenda filter by an additional condition.  When
     called with prefix arg, remove the entries that _do_ have the tag,
     or that do match the effort criterion.  You can achieve the same
     effect by pressing `+' or `-' as the first key after the `/'
     command.

`[ ] { }'

    in search view
          add new search words (`[' and `]') or new regular expressions
          (`{' and `}') to the query string.  The opening bracket/brace
          will add a positive search term prefixed by `+', indicating
          that this search term must occur/match in the entry.  The
          closing bracket/brace will add a negative search term which
          must not occur/match in the entry for it to be selected.

Remote editing
..............

`0-9'
     Digit argument.  

`C-_'
     Undo a change due to a remote editing command.  The change is
     undone both in the agenda buffer and in the remote buffer.  

`t'
     Change the TODO state of the item, both in the agenda and in the
     original org file.  

`C-k'
     Delete the current agenda item along with the entire subtree
     belonging to it in the original Org file.  If the text to be
     deleted remotely is longer than one line, the kill needs to be
     confirmed by the user.  See variable `org-agenda-confirm-kill'.  

`C-c C-w'
     Refile the entry at point.  

`a'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  

`A'
     Move the subtree corresponding to the current entry to its _archive
     sibling_.  

`$'
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the current headline.  This
     means the entry will be moved to the configured archive location,
     most likely a different file.  

`T'
     Show all tags associated with the current item.  This is useful if
     you have turned off `org-agenda-show-inherited-tags', but still
     want to see all tags of a headline occasionally.  

`:'
     Set tags for the current headline.  If there is an active region
     in the agenda, change a tag for all headings in the region.  

`,'
     Set the priority for the current item.  Org mode prompts for the
     priority character. If you reply with <SPC>, the priority cookie
     is removed from the entry.  

`P'
     Display weighted priority of current item.  

`+'
`S-<up>'
     Increase the priority of the current item.  The priority is
     changed in the original buffer, but the agenda is not resorted.
     Use the `r' key for this.  

`-'
`S-<down>'
     Decrease the priority of the current item.  

`z'
     Add a note to the entry.  This note will be recorded, and then
     files to the same location where state change notes are put.
     Depending on `org-log-into-drawer', this maybe inside a drawer.  

`C-c C-a'
     Dispatcher for all command related to attachments.  

`C-c C-s'
     Schedule this item 

`C-c C-d'
     Set a deadline for this item.  

`k'
     Agenda actions, to set dates for selected items to the cursor date.
     This command also works in the calendar!  The command prompts for
     an additional key:
          m   Mark the entry at point for action.  You can also make entries
              in Org files with `C-c C-x C-k'.
          d   Set the deadline of the marked entry to the date at point.
          s   Schedule the marked entry at the date at point.
          r   Call `org-remember' with the cursor date as default date.
     Press `r' afterward to refresh the agenda and see the effect of the
     command.  

`S-<right>'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the future.  With a numeric prefix argument, change it by
     that many days.  For example, `3 6 5 S-<right>' will change it by
     a year.  With a `C-u' prefix, change the time by one hour.  If you
     immediately repeat the command, it will continue to change hours
     even without the prefix arg.  With a double `C-u C-u' prefix, do
     the same for changing minutes.  The stamp is changed in the
     original Org file, but the change is not directly reflected in the
     agenda buffer.  Use `r' or `g' to update the buffer.  

`S-<left>'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the past.  

`>'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line to today.
     The key `>' has been chosen, because it is the same as `S-.' on my
     keyboard.  

`I'
     Start the clock on the current item.  If a clock is running
     already, it is stopped first.  

`O'
     Stop the previously started clock.  

`X'
     Cancel the currently running clock.

`J'
     Jump to the running clock in another window.

Bulk remote editing selected entries
....................................

`s'
     Mark the entry at point for bulk action.

`u'
     Unmark entry for bulk action.

`U'
     Unmark all marked entries for bulk action.

`B'
     Bulk action: act on all marked entries in the agenda.  This will
     prompt for another key to select the action to be applied:
          r  Prompt for a single refile target and move all entries.  The entries
             will no longer be in the agenda, refresh (`g') to bring them back.
          $  Archive all selected entries.
          A  Archive entries by moving them to their respective archive siblings.
          t  Change TODO state.  This prompts for a single TODO keyword and
             changes the state of all selected entries, bypassing blocking and
             suppressing logging notes (but not time stamps).
          +  Add a tag to all selected entries.
          -  Remove a tag from all selected entries.
          s  Schedule all items to a new date.  To shift existing schedule dates
             by a fixed number of days, use something starting with double plus
             at the prompt, for example `++8d' or `++2w'.
          d  Set deadline to a specific date.

Calendar commands
.................

`c'
     Open the Emacs calendar and move to the date at the agenda cursor.

`c'
     When in the calendar, compute and show the Org mode agenda for the
     date at the cursor.  

`i'
     Insert a new entry into the diary.  Prompts for the type of entry
     (day, weekly, monthly, yearly, anniversary, cyclic) and creates a
     new entry in the diary, just as `i d', etc., would do in the
     calendar.  The date is taken from the cursor position.  

`M'
     Show the phases of the moon for the three months around current
     date.  

`S'
     Show sunrise and sunset times.  The geographical location must be
     set with calendar variables, see the documentation for the Emacs
     calendar.  

`C'
     Convert the date at cursor into many other cultural and historic
     calendars.  

`H'
     Show holidays for three months around the cursor date.

`M-x org-export-icalendar-combine-agenda-files'
     Export a single iCalendar file containing entries from all agenda
     files.  This is a globally available command, and also available
     in the agenda menu.

Exporting to a file
...................

`C-x C-w'
     Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of
     the selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML
     (extension `.html' or `.htm'), Postscript (extension `.ps'), PDF
     (extension `.pdf'), Org-mode (extension `.org'), and plain text
     (any other extension).  When called with a `C-u' prefix argument,
     immediately open the newly created file.  Use the variable
     `org-agenda-exporter-settings' to set options for `ps-print' and
     for `htmlize' to be used during export.

Quit and Exit
.............

`q'
     Quit agenda, remove the agenda buffer.  

`x'
     Exit agenda, remove the agenda buffer and all buffers loaded by
     Emacs for the compilation of the agenda.  Buffers created by the
     user to visit Org files will not be removed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Custom commands can preset a filter by binding the variable
`org-agenda-filter-preset' as an option.  This filter will then be
applied to the view and persist as a basic filter through refreshes and
more secondary filtering.

10.6 Custom agenda views
========================

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::), just like the default commands.

* Menu:

* Storing searches::            Type once, use often
* Block agenda::                All the stuff you need in a single buffer
* Setting Options::             Changing the rules


File: org,  Node: Storing searches,  Next: Block agenda,  Prev: Custom agenda views,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.1 Storing searches
-----------------------

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).  Custom commands are configured in the variable
`org-agenda-custom-commands'.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing `C-c a C'.  You can also directly set it with Emacs
Lisp in `.emacs'.  The following example contains all valid search
types:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING")
             ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
             ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
             ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")
             ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent")
             ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
             ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ; description for "h" prefix
             ("hl" tags "+home+Lisa")
             ("hp" tags "+home+Peter")
             ("hk" tags "+home+Kim")))

The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command `C-c a' in order to access the command.
Usually this will be just a single character, but if you have many
similar commands, you can also define two-letter combinations where the
first character is the same in several combinations and serves as a
prefix key(1).  The second parameter is the search type, followed by
the string or regular expression to be used for the matching.  The
example above will therefore define:

`C-c a w'
     as a global search for TODO entries with `WAITING' as the TODO
     keyword

`C-c a W'
     as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying
     the results as a sparse tree

`C-c a u'
     as a global tags search for headlines marked `:boss:' but not
     `:urgent:'

`C-c a v'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but limiting the search to
     headlines that are also TODO items

`C-c a U'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but only in the current buffer and
     displaying the result as a sparse tree

`C-c a f'
     to create a sparse tree (again: current buffer only) with all
     entries containing the word `FIXME'

`C-c a h'
     as a prefix command for a HOME tags search where you have to press
     an additional key (`l', `p' or `k') to select a name (Lisa, Peter,
     or Kim) as additional tag to match.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can provide a description for a prefix key by inserting a
cons cell with the prefix and the description.


File: org,  Node: Block agenda,  Next: Setting Options,  Prev: Storing searches,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.2 Block agenda
-------------------

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of _several_ commands, each of which creates a block in the
agenda buffer.  The available commands include `agenda' for the daily
or weekly agenda (as created with `C-c a a'), `alltodo' for the global
TODO list (as constructed with `C-c a t'), and the matching commands
discussed above: `todo', `tags', and `tags-todo'.  Here are two
examples:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden")))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office")))))

This will define `C-c a h' to create a multi-block view for stuff you
need to attend to at home.  The resulting agenda buffer will contain
your agenda for the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag
`home', and also all lines tagged with `garden'.  Finally the command
`C-c a o' provides a similar view for office tasks.


File: org,  Node: Setting Options,  Prev: Block agenda,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.3 Setting options for custom commands
------------------------------------------

Org mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
and display.  The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
commands, including the custom commands.  However, if you want to change
some settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.  Setting
options requires inserting a list of variable names and values at the
right spot in `org-agenda-custom-commands'.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING"
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
               (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed: ")))
             ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent"
              ((org-show-following-heading nil)
               (org-show-hierarchy-above nil)))
             ("N" search ""
              ((org-agenda-files '("~org/notes.org"))
               (org-agenda-text-search-extra-files nil)))))

Now the `C-c a w' command will sort the collected entries only by
priority, and the prefix format is modified to just say `  Mixed: '
instead of giving the category of the entry.  The sparse tags tree of
`C-c a U' will now turn out ultra-compact, because neither the headline
hierarchy above the match, nor the headline following the match will be
shown.  The command `C-c a N' will do a text search limited to only a
single file.

   For command sets creating a block agenda,
`org-agenda-custom-commands' has two separate spots for setting
options.  You can add options that should be valid for just a single
command in the set, and options that should be valid for all commands in
the set.  The former are just added to the command entry, the latter
must come after the list of command entries.  Going back to the block
agenda example (*note Block agenda::), let's change the sorting strategy
for the `C-c a h' commands to `priority-down', but let's sort the
results for GARDEN tags query in the opposite order, `priority-up'.
This would look like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden"
                     ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up)))))
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office")))))

   As you see, the values and parentheses setting is a little complex.
When in doubt, use the customize interface to set this variable--it
fully supports its structure.  Just one caveat: when setting options in
this interface, the _values_ are just Lisp expressions.  So if the
value is a string, you need to add the double-quotes around the value
yourself.

10.7 Exporting Agenda Views
===========================

If you are away from your computer, it can be very useful to have a
printed version of some agenda views to carry around.  Org mode can
export custom agenda views as plain text, HTML(1), Postscript, PDF(2),
and iCalendar files.  If you want to do this only occasionally, use the
command

`C-x C-w'
     Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of
     the selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML
     (extension `.html' or `.htm'), Postscript (extension `.ps'),
     iCalendar (extension `.ics'), Org-mode (extension `.org'), or
     plain text (any other extension).  Use the variable
     `org-agenda-exporter-settings' to set options for `ps-print' and
     for `htmlize' to be used during export, for example

          (setq org-agenda-exporter-settings
                '((ps-number-of-columns 2)
                  (ps-landscape-mode t)
                  (org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines 5)
                  (htmlize-output-type 'css)))

   If you need to export certain agenda views frequently, you can
associate any custom agenda command with a list of output file names
(3).  Here is an example that first defines custom commands for the
agenda and the global TODO list, together with a number of files to
which to export them.  Then we define two block agenda commands and
specify file names for them as well.  File names can be relative to the
current working directory, or absolute.

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
             ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
             ("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "home")
               (tags "garden"))
              nil
              ("~/views/home.html"))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "work")
               (tags "office"))
              nil
              ("~/views/office.ps" "~/calendars/office.ics"))))

   The extension of the file name determines the type of export.  If it
is `.html', Org mode will use the `htmlize.el' package to convert the
buffer to HTML and save it to this file name.  If the extension is
`.ps', `ps-print-buffer-with-faces' is used to produce Postscript
output.  If the extension is `.ics', iCalendar export is run export
over all files that were used to construct the agenda, and limit the
export to entries listed in the agenda.  Any other extension produces a
plain ASCII file.

   The export files are _not_ created when you use one of those
commands interactively because this might use too much overhead.
Instead, there is a special command to produce _all_ specified files in
one step:

`C-c a e'
     Export all agenda views that have export file names associated with
     them.

   You can use the options section of the custom agenda commands to also
set options for the export commands.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda ""
              ((ps-number-of-columns 2)
               (ps-landscape-mode t)
               (org-agenda-prefix-format " [ ] ")
               (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
               (org-agenda-remove-tags t))
              ("theagenda.ps"))))

This command sets two options for the Postscript exporter, to make it
print in two columns in landscape format--the resulting page can be cut
in two and then used in a paper agenda.  The remaining settings modify
the agenda prefix to omit category and scheduling information, and
instead include a checkbox to check off items.  We also remove the tags
to make the lines compact, and we don't want to use colors for the
black-and-white printer.  Settings specified in
`org-agenda-exporter-settings' will also apply, but the settings in
`org-agenda-custom-commands' take precedence.

From the command line you may also use
     emacs -f org-batch-store-agenda-views -kill
   or, if you need to modify some parameters(4)
     emacs -eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views                      \
                   org-agenda-ndays 30                               \
                   org-agenda-start-day "2007-11-01"                 \
                   org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                   org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
           -kill
   which will create the agenda views restricted to the file
`~/org/project.org', without diary entries and with a 30-day extent.

   You can also extract agenda information in a way that allows further
processing by other programs.  See *note Extracting agenda
information::, for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You need to install Hrvoje Niksic's `htmlize.el'.

the global TODO list as well, you need to define custom commands for
them in order to be able to specify file names.

File: org,  Node: Agenda column view,  Prev: Exporting Agenda Views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.8 Using column view in the agenda
====================================

Column view (*note Column view::) is normally used to view and edit
properties embedded in the hierarchical structure of an Org file.  It
can be quite useful to use column view also from the agenda, where
entries are collected by certain criteria.

`C-c C-x C-c'
     Turn on column view in the agenda.

   To understand how to use this properly, it is important to realize
that the entries in the agenda are no longer in their proper outline
environment.  This causes the following issues:

  1. Org needs to make a decision which `COLUMNS' format to use.  Since
     the entries in the agenda are collected from different files, and
     different files may have different `COLUMNS' formats, this is a
     non-trivial problem.  Org first checks if the variable
     `org-overriding-columns-format' is currently set, and if so, takes
     the format from there.  Otherwise it takes the format associated
     with the first item in the agenda, or, if that item does not have
     a specific format (defined in a property, or in its file), it uses
     `org-columns-default-format'.

  2. If any of the columns has a summary type defined (*note Column
     attributes::), turning on column view in the agenda will visit all
     relevant agenda files and make sure that the computations of this
     property are up to date.  This is also true for the special
     `CLOCKSUM' property.  Org will then sum the values displayed in
     the agenda.  In the daily/weekly agenda, the sums will cover a
     single day, in all other views they cover the entire block.  It is
     vital to realize that the agenda may show the same entry _twice_
     (for example as scheduled and as a deadline), and it may show two
     entries from the same hierarchy (for example a _parent_ and its
     _child_).  In these cases, the summation in the agenda will lead
     to incorrect results because some values will count double.

  3. When the column view in the agenda shows the `CLOCKSUM', that is
     always the entire clocked time for this item.  So even in the
     daily/weekly agenda, the clocksum listed in column view may
     originate from times outside the current view.  This has the
     advantage that you can compare these values with a column listing
     the planned total effort for a task--one of the major applications
     for column view in the agenda.  If you want information about
     clocked time in the displayed period use clock table mode (press
     `R' in the agenda).

Plain ASCII is normally sufficient for almost all note taking.  One
exception, however, are scientific notes which need to be able to
contain mathematical symbols and the occasional formula.  LaTeX(1)  is
widely used to typeset scientific documents. Org mode supports
embedding LaTeX code into its files, because many academics are used to
reading LaTeX source code, and because it can be readily processed into

   It is not necessary to mark LaTeX macros and code in any special way.
If you observe a few conventions, Org mode knows how to find it and what

11.1 Math symbols
=================

You can use LaTeX macros to insert special symbols like `\alpha' to
indicate the Greek letter, or `\to' to indicate an arrow.  Completion
for these macros is available, just type `\' and maybe a few letters,
and press `M-<TAB>' to see possible completions.  Unlike LaTeX code,
Org mode allows these macros to be present without surrounding math
delimiters, for example:

     Angles are written as Greek letters \alpha, \beta and \gamma.
   During HTML export (*note HTML export::), these symbols are
translated into the proper syntax for HTML, for the above examples this
is `&alpha;' and `&rarr;', respectively.  If you need such a symbol
inside a word, terminate it like this: `\Aacute{}stor'.


File: org,  Node: Subscripts and superscripts,  Next: LaTeX fragments,  Prev: Math symbols,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.2 Subscripts and superscripts
================================

Just like in LaTeX, `^' and `_' are used to indicate super- and
subscripts.  Again, these can be used without embedding them in
math-mode delimiters.  To increase the readability of ASCII text, it is
not necessary (but OK) to surround multi-character sub- and superscripts
with curly braces.  For example

     The mass if the sun is M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg.  The radius of
     the sun is R_{sun} = 6.96 x 10^8 m.

   To avoid interpretation as raised or lowered text, you can quote `^'
and `_' with a backslash: `\^' and `\_'.

   During HTML export (*note HTML export::), subscript and superscripts
are surrounded with `<sub>' and `<sup>' tags, respectively.


File: org,  Node: LaTeX fragments,  Next: Processing LaTeX fragments,  Prev: Subscripts and superscripts,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.3 LaTeX fragments
====================

With symbols, sub- and superscripts, HTML is pretty much at its end when
it comes to representing mathematical formulas(1). More complex
expressions need a dedicated formula processor. To this end, Org mode
can contain arbitrary LaTeX fragments. It provides commands to preview
the typeset result of these fragments, and upon export to HTML, all
fragments will be converted to images and inlined into the HTML
document(2). For this to work you need to be on a system with a working
LaTeX installation. You also need the `dvipng' program, available at
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/'. The LaTeX header that will
be used when processing a fragment can be configured with the variable
`org-format-latex-header'.

   LaTeX fragments don't need any special marking at all.  The following
snippets will be identified as LaTeX source code:
   * Environments of any kind.  The only requirement is that the
     `\begin' statement appears on a new line, preceded by only
     whitespace.

   * Text within the usual LaTeX math delimiters.  To avoid conflicts
     with currency specifications, single `$' characters are only
     recognized as math delimiters if the enclosed text contains at
     most two line breaks, is directly attached to the `$' characters
     with no whitespace in between, and if the closing `$' is followed
     by whitespace, punctuation or a dash.  For the other delimiters,
     there is no such restriction, so when in doubt, use `\(...\)' as
     inline math delimiters.

For example:

     \begin{equation}                          % arbitrary environments,
     x=\sqrt{b}                                % even tables, figures
     \end{equation}                            % etc

     If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
     either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

If you need any of the delimiter ASCII sequences for other purposes, you
can configure the option `org-format-latex-options' to deselect the
ones you do not wish to have interpreted by the LaTeX converter.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Yes, there is MathML, but that is not yet fully supported by
many browsers, and there is no decent converter for turning LaTeX or
ASCII representations of formulas into MathML. So for the time being,
converting formulas into images seems the way to go.

   (2) The LaTeX export will not use images for displaying LaTeX
fragments but include these fragments directly into the LaTeX code.


File: org,  Node: Processing LaTeX fragments,  Next: CDLaTeX mode,  Prev: LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.4 Processing LaTeX fragments
===============================

LaTeX fragments can be processed to produce preview images of the
typeset expressions:

`C-c C-x C-l'
     Produce a preview image of the LaTeX fragment at point and overlay
     it over the source code.  If there is no fragment at point,
     process all fragments in the current entry (between two
     headlines).  When called with a prefix argument, process the
     entire subtree.  When called with two prefix arguments, or when
     the cursor is before the first headline, process the entire buffer.  

`C-c C-c'
     Remove the overlay preview images.

   You can customize the variable `org-format-latex-options' to
influence some aspects of the preview. In particular, the `:scale' (and
for HTML export, `:html-scale') property can be used to adjust the size
of the preview images.

   During HTML export (*note HTML export::), all LaTeX fragments are
converted into images and inlined into the document if the following
setting is active:

     (setq org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments t)


File: org,  Node: CDLaTeX mode,  Prev: Processing LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.5 Using CDLaTeX to enter math
================================

CDLaTeX mode is a minor mode that is normally used in combination with a
major LaTeX mode like AUCTeX in order to speed-up insertion of
environments and math templates.  Inside Org mode, you can make use of
some of the features of CDLaTeX mode.  You need to install `cdlatex.el'
and `texmathp.el' (the latter comes also with AUCTeX) from
`http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex'.  Don't use CDLaTeX
mode itself under Org mode, but use the light version
`org-cdlatex-mode' that comes as part of Org mode.  Turn it on for the
current buffer with `M-x org-cdlatex-mode', or for all Org files with

     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)

   When this mode is enabled, the following features are present (for
more details see the documentation of CDLaTeX mode):
   * Environment templates can be inserted with `C-c {'.

   * The <TAB> key will do template expansion if the cursor is inside a
     LaTeX fragment(1).  For example, <TAB> will expand `fr' to
     `\frac{}{}' and position the cursor correctly inside the first
     brace.  Another <TAB> will get you into the second brace.  Even
     outside fragments, <TAB> will expand environment abbreviations at
     the beginning of a line.  For example, if you write `equ' at the
     beginning of a line and press <TAB>, this abbreviation will be
     expanded to an `equation' environment.  To get a list of all
     abbreviations, type `M-x cdlatex-command-help'.

   * Pressing `_' and `^' inside a LaTeX fragment will insert these
     characters together with a pair of braces.  If you use <TAB> to
     move out of the braces, and if the braces surround only a single
     character or macro, they are removed again (depending on the
     variable `cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts').

   * Pressing the backquote ``' followed by a character inserts math
     macros, also outside LaTeX fragments.  If you wait more than 1.5
     seconds after the backquote, a help window will pop up.

   * Pressing the single-quote `'' followed by another character
     modifies the symbol before point with an accent or a font.  If you
     wait more than 1.5 seconds after the backquote, a help window will
     pop up.  Character modification will work only inside LaTeX
     fragments, outside the quote is normal.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org mode has a method to test if the cursor is inside such a
fragment, see the documentation of the function
`org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p'.

12 Exporting
************

Org-mode documents can be exported into a variety of other formats.  For
printing and sharing of notes, ASCII export produces a readable and
simple version of an Org file.  HTML export allows you to publish a
notes file on the web, while the XOXO format provides a solid base for
exchange with a broad range of other applications. LaTeX export lets
you use Org mode and its structured editing functions to easily create
LaTeX files.  DocBook export makes it possible to convert Org files to
many other formats using DocBook tools.  To incorporate entries with
associated times like deadlines or appointments into a desktop calendar
program like iCal, Org mode can also produce extracts in the iCalendar
format.  Currently Org mode only supports export, not import of these
different formats.

   Org supports export of selected regions when `transient-mark-mode' is
enabled (default in Emacs 23).

12.1 Markup rules
=================

When exporting Org-mode documents, the exporter tries to reflect the
structure of the document as accurately as possible in the backend.
Since export targets like HTML, LaTeX, or DocBook allow much richer
formatting, Org mode has rules on how to prepare text for rich export.
This section summarizes the markup rules used in an Org-mode buffer.

* Menu:

* Document title::              How the document title is determined
* Headings and sections::       The main structure of the exported document
* Table of contents::           If, where, how to create a table of contents
* Initial text::                Text before the first headline
* Lists::                       Plain lists are exported

Document title
--------------

The title of the exported document is taken from the special line

     #+TITLE: This is the title of the document

If this line does not exist, the title is derived from the first
non-empty, non-comment line in the buffer.  If no such line exists, or
if you have turned off exporting of the text before the first headline
(see below), the title will be the file name without extension.

   If you are exporting only a subtree by marking is as the region, the
heading of the subtree will become the title of the document.  If the
subtree has a property `EXPORT_TITLE', that will take precedence.


File: org,  Node: Headings and sections,  Next: Table of contents,  Prev: Document title,  Up: Markup rules

Headings and sections
---------------------

The outline structure of the document as described in *note Document
Structure::, forms the basis for defining sections of the exported
document.  However, since the outline structure is also used for (for
example) lists of tasks, only the first three outline levels will be
used as headings.  Deeper levels will become itemized lists.  You can
change the location of this switch globally by setting the variable
`org-export-headline-levels', or on a per-file basis with a line

     #+OPTIONS: H:4


File: org,  Node: Table of contents,  Next: Initial text,  Prev: Headings and sections,  Up: Markup rules

Table of contents
-----------------

The table of contents is normally inserted directly before the first
headline of the file.  If you would like to get it to a different
location, insert the string `[TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]' on a line by itself
at the desired location.  The depth of the table of contents is by
default the same as the number of headline levels, but you can choose a
smaller number, or turn off the table of contents entirely, by
configuring the variable `org-export-with-toc', or on a per-file basis
with a line like

     #+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only to two levels in TOC)
     #+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no TOC at all)


File: org,  Node: Initial text,  Next: Lists,  Prev: Table of contents,  Up: Markup rules

Text before the first headline
------------------------------

Org mode normally exports the text before the first headline, and even
uses the first line as the document title.  The text will be fully
marked up.  If you need to include literal HTML, LaTeX, or DocBook
code, use the special constructs described below in the sections for
the individual exporters.

   Some people like to use the space before the first headline for
setup and internal links and therefore would like to control the
exported text before the first headline in a different way.  You can do
so by setting the variable `org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading' to
`t'.  On a per-file basis, you can get the same effect with `#+OPTIONS:
skip:t'.

If you still want to have some text before the first headline, use the
`#+TEXT' construct:

     #+OPTIONS: skip:t
     #+TEXT: This text will go before the *first* headline.
     #+TEXT: [TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]
     #+TEXT: This goes between the table of contents and the first headline


File: org,  Node: Lists,  Next: Paragraphs,  Prev: Initial text,  Up: Markup rules

Lists
-----

Plain lists as described in *note Plain lists::, are translated to the
backend's syntax for such lists.  Most backends support unordered,
ordered, and description lists.


File: org,  Node: Paragraphs,  Next: Literal examples,  Prev: Lists,  Up: Markup rules

Paragraphs, line breaks, and quoting
------------------------------------

Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.  If you need to
enforce a line break within a paragraph, use `\\' at the end of a line.

   To keep the line breaks in a region, but otherwise use normal
formatting, you can use this construct, which can also be used to
format poetry.

     #+BEGIN_VERSE
      Great clouds overhead
      Tiny black birds rise and fall
      Snow covers Emacs

          -- AlexSchroeder
     #+END_VERSE

   When quoting a passage from another document, it is customary to
format this as a paragraph that is indented on both the left and the
right margin.  You can include quotations in Org-mode documents like
this:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Everything should be made as simple as possible,
     but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
     #+END_QUOTE

   If you would like to center some text, do it like this: 
     #+BEGIN_CENTER
     Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
     but not any simpler
     #+END_CENTER


File: org,  Node: Literal examples,  Next: Include files,  Prev: Paragraphs,  Up: Markup rules

Literal examples
----------------

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to
markup.  Such examples will be typeset in monospace, so this is well
suited for source code and similar examples.  

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Some example from a text file.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   Note that such blocks may be indented in order to align nicely with
indented text and in particular with plain list structure (*note Plain
lists::).  For simplicity when using small examples, you can also start
the example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may also be
additional whitespace before the colon:

     Here is an example
        : Some example from a text file.

   If the example is source code from a programming language, or any
other text that can be marked up by font-lock in Emacs, you can ask for
the example to look like the fontified Emacs buffer(1).  This is done
with the `src' block, where you also need to specify the name of the
major mode that should be used to fontify the example: 

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Exclusive or."
        (if a (not b) b))
     #+END_SRC

   Both in `example' and in `src' snippets, you can add a `-n' switch
to the end of the `BEGIN' line, to get the lines of the example
numbered.  If you use a `+n' switch, the numbering from the previous
numbered snippet will be continued in the current one.  In literal
examples, Org will interpret strings like `(ref:name)' as labels, and
use them as targets for special hyperlinks like `[[(name)]]' (i.e.,
enclosed in single parenthesis).  In HTML, hovering the mouse over such
a link will remote-highlight the corresponding code line, which is kind
of cool.

   You can also add a `-r' switch which removes the labels from the
source code(2).  With the `-n' switch, links to these references will
be labeled by the line numbers from the code listing, otherwise links
will use the labels with no parentheses.  Here is an example:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
     (save-excursion                  (ref:sc)
        (goto-char (point-min))       (ref:jump)
     #+END_SRC
     In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position.  [[(jump)][Line (jump)]]
     jumps to point-min.

   If the syntax for the label format conflicts with the language
syntax, use a `-l' switch to change the format, for example
`#+BEGIN_SRC pascal -n -r -l "((%s))"'.  See also the variable
`org-coderef-label-format'.

   HTML export also allows examples to be published as text areas,
*Note Text areas in HTML export::.

`C-c ''
     Edit the source code example at point in its native mode.  This
     works by switching to a temporary buffer with the source code.
     You need to exit by pressing `C-c '' again(3), the edited version
     will then replace the old version in the Org buffer.  Fixed-width
     regions (where each line starts with a colon followed by a space)
     will be edited using `artist-mode'(4) to allow creating ASCII
     drawings easily.  Using this command in an empty line will create
     a new fixed-width region.  

`C-c l'
     Calling `org-store-link' while editing a source code example in a
     temporary buffer created with `C-c '' will prompt for a label,
     make sure that it is unique in the current buffer, and insert it
     with the proper formatting like `(ref:label)' at the end of the
     current line.  Then the label is stored as a link `(label)', for
     retrieval with `C-c C-l'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Currently this works for the HTML backend, and requires the
`htmlize.el' package version 1.34 or later.  It also works for LaTeX
with the listings package, if you turn on the option
`org-export-latex-listings' and make sure that the listings package is
included by the LaTeX header.

   (2) Adding `-k' to `-n -r' will keep the labels in the source code
while using line numbers for the links, which might be useful to
explain those in an org-mode example code.

   (3) Upon exit, lines starting with `*' or `#' will get a comma
prepended, to keep them from being interpreted by Org as outline nodes
or special comments.  These commas will be striped for editing with
`C-c '', and also for export.

   (4) You may select a different-mode with the variable
`org-edit-fixed-width-region-mode'.


File: org,  Node: Include files,  Next: Tables exported,  Prev: Literal examples,  Up: Markup rules

Include files
-------------

During export, you can include the content of another file.  For
example, to include your `.emacs' file, you could use: 

     #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp
   The optional second and third parameter are the markup (e.g. `quote',
`example', or `src'), and, if the markup is `src', the language for
formatting the contents.  The markup is optional, if it is not given,
the text will be assumed to be in Org mode format and will be processed
normally.  The include line will also allow additional keyword
parameters `:prefix1' and `:prefix' to specify prefixes for the first
line and for each following line, as well as any options accepted by
the selected markup.  For example, to include a file as an item, use

     #+INCLUDE: "~/snippets/xx" :prefix1 "   + " :prefix "     "

`C-c ''
     Visit the include file at point.


File: org,  Node: Tables exported,  Next: Inlined images,  Prev: Include files,  Up: Markup rules

Tables
------

Both the native Org mode tables (*note Tables::) and tables formatted
with the `table.el' package will be exported properly.  For Org mode
tables, the lines before the first horizontal separator line will
become table header lines.  You can use the following lines somewhere
before the table to assign a caption and a label for cross references:

     #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
     #+LABEL:   tbl:basic-data


File: org,  Node: Inlined images,  Next: Footnote markup,  Prev: Tables exported,  Up: Markup rules

Inlined Images
--------------

Some backends (HTML, LaTeX, and DocBook) allow you to directly include
images into the exported document.  Org does this, if a link to an
image files does not have a description part, for example
`[[./img/a.jpg]]'.  If you wish to define a caption for the image and
maybe a label for internal cross references, you can use (before, but
close to the link)

     #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
     #+LABEL:   fig:SED-HR4049

   You may also define additional attributes for the figure.  As this is
backend-specific, see the sections about the individual backends for
more information.


File: org,  Node: Footnote markup,  Next: Emphasis and monospace,  Prev: Inlined images,  Up: Markup rules

Footnote markup
---------------

Footnotes defined in the way described in *note Footnotes::, will be
exported by all backends.  Org allows multiple references to the same
note, and different backends support this to varying degrees.


File: org,  Node: Emphasis and monospace,  Next: TeX macros and LaTeX fragments,  Prev: Footnote markup,  Up: Markup rules

Emphasis and monospace
----------------------

You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, `=code=' and
`~verbatim~', and, if you must, `+strike-through+'.  Text in the code
and verbatim string is not processed for Org-mode specific syntax, it
is exported verbatim.


File: org,  Node: TeX macros and LaTeX fragments,  Next: Horizontal rules,  Prev: Emphasis and monospace,  Up: Markup rules

TeX macros and LaTeX fragments
------------------------------

A TeX-like syntax is used to specify special characters.  Where
possible, these will be transformed into the native format of the
exporter backend.  Strings like `\alpha' will be exported as `&alpha;'
in the HTML output, and as `$\alpha$' in the LaTeX output.  Similarly,
`\nbsp' will become `&nbsp;' in HTML and `~' in LaTeX.  This applies
for a large number of entities, with names taken from both HTML and
LaTeX, see the variable `org-html-entities' for the complete list.  If
you are unsure about a name, use `M-<TAB>' for completion after having
typed the backslash and optionally a few characters (*note
Completion::).

   LaTeX fragments are converted into images for HTML export, and they
are written literally into the LaTeX export.  See also *note Embedded
LaTeX::.

   Finally, `\-' is treated as a shy hyphen, and `--', `---', and `...'
are all converted into special commands creating hyphens of different
lengths or a compact set of dots.

Lines starting with `#' in column zero are treated as comments and will

-----------------

You can define text snippets with

which can be referenced anywhere in the document (even in code
examples) with `{{{name(arg1,arg2)}}}'.  In addition to defined macros,
`{{{title}}}', `{{{author}}}', etc., will reference information set by
the `#+TITLE:', `#+AUTHOR:', and similar lines.  Also,
`{{{date(FORMAT)}}}' and `{{{modification-time(FORMAT)}}}' refer to
current date time and to the modification time of the file being
exported, respectively.  FORMAT should be a format string understood by
`format-time-string'.


File: org,  Node: Selective export,  Next: Export options,  Prev: Markup rules,  Up: Exporting

12.2 Selective export
=====================

You may use tags to select the parts of a document that should be
exported, or to exclude parts from export.  This behavior is governed
by two variables: `org-export-select-tags' and
`org-export-exclude-tags'.

   Org first checks if any of the _select_ tags is present in the
buffer.  If yes, all trees that do not carry one of these tags will be
excluded.  If a selected tree is a subtree, the heading hierarchy above
it will also be selected for export, but not the text below those
headings.

If none of the select tags is found, the whole buffer will be selected
for export.

Finally, all subtrees that are marked by any of the _exclude_ tags will
be removed from the export buffer.


File: org,  Node: Export options,  Next: The export dispatcher,  Prev: Selective export,  Up: Exporting

12.3 Export options
===================

The exporter recognizes special lines in the buffer which provide
additional information.  These lines may be put anywhere in the file.
The whole set of lines can be inserted into the buffer with `C-c C-e
t'.  For individual lines, a good way to make sure the keyword is
correct is to type `#+' and then use `M-<TAB>' completion (*note
Completion::).   For a summary of other in-buffer settings not
specifically related to export, see *note In-buffer settings::.  In
particular, note that you can place commonly-used (export) options in a
separate file which can be included using `#+SETUPFILE'.

`C-c C-e t'
     Insert template with export options, see example below.

     #+TITLE:       the title to be shown (default is the buffer name)
     #+AUTHOR:      the author (default taken from `user-full-name')
     #+DATE:        a date, fixed, of a format string for `format-time-string'
     #+EMAIL:       his/her email address (default from `user-mail-address')
     #+DESCRIPTION: the page description, e.g.,
     #+KEYWORDS:    the page keywords, e.g.,
     #+LANGUAGE:    language for HTML, e.g.,
     #+TEXT:        Some descriptive text to be inserted at the beginning.
     #+TEXT:        Several lines may be given.
     #+OPTIONS:     H:2 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:t f:t TeX:t ...
     #+BIND:        lisp-var lisp-val, e.g.: org-export-latex-low-levels itemize
                    You need to confirm using these, or configure `org-export-allow-BIND'
     #+LINK_UP:     the ``up'' link of an exported page
     #+LINK_HOME:   the ``home'' link of an exported page
     #+LATEX_HEADER: extra line(s) for the LaTeX header, like \usepackage{xyz}
     #+EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS:   Tags that select a tree for export
     #+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS:  Tags that exclude a tree from export

The OPTIONS line is a compact(1) form to specify export settings.  Here
you can: 
     H:         set the number of headline levels for export
     num:       turn on/off section-numbers
     toc:       turn on/off table of contents, or set level limit (integer)
     \n:        turn on/off line-break-preservation
     @:         turn on/off quoted HTML tags
     ::         turn on/off fixed-width sections
     |:         turn on/off tables
     ^:         turn on/off TeX-like syntax for sub- and superscripts.  If
                you write "^:{}", `a_{b}' will be interpreted, but
                the simple `a_b' will be left as it is.
     -:         turn on/off conversion of special strings.
     f:         turn on/off footnotes like this[1].
     todo:      turn on/off inclusion of TODO keywords into exported text
     pri:       turn on/off priority cookies
     tags:      turn on/off inclusion of tags, may also be `not-in-toc'
     <:         turn on/off inclusion of any time/date stamps like DEADLINES
     *:         turn on/off emphasized text (bold, italic, underlined)
     TeX:       turn on/off simple TeX macros in plain text
     LaTeX:     turn on/off LaTeX fragments
     skip:      turn on/off skipping the text before the first heading
     author:    turn on/off inclusion of author name/email into exported file
     creator:   turn on/off inclusion of creator info into exported file
     timestamp: turn on/off inclusion creation time into exported file
     d:         turn on/off inclusion of drawers
   These options take effect in both the HTML and LaTeX export, except
for `TeX' and `LaTeX', which are respectively `t' and `nil' for the
LaTeX export.

   When exporting only a single subtree by selecting it with `C-c @'
before calling an export command, the subtree can overrule some of the
file's export settings with properties `EXPORT_FILE_NAME',
`EXPORT_TITLE', `EXPORT_TEXT', `EXPORT_AUTHOR', `EXPORT_DATE', and
`EXPORT_OPTIONS'.

several OPTIONS lines.

12.4 The export dispatcher
==========================

All export commands can be reached using the export dispatcher, which
is a prefix key that prompts for an additional key specifying the
command.  Normally the entire file is exported, but if there is an
active region that contains one outline tree, the first heading is used
as document title and the subtrees are exported.

`C-c C-e'
     Dispatcher for export and publishing commands.  Displays a
     help-window listing the additional key(s) needed to launch an
     export or publishing command.  The prefix arg is passed through to
     the exporter.  A double prefix `C-u C-u' causes most commands to
     be executed in the background, in a separate Emacs process(1).  

`C-c C-e v'
     Like `C-c C-e', but only export the text that is currently visible
     (i.e., 

`C-u C-u C-c C-e'
     Call an the exporter, but reverse the setting of
     `org-export-run-in-background', i.e., not set, or force processing
     in the current Emacs process if set.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To make this behavior the default, customize the variable
`org-export-run-in-background'.


File: org,  Node: ASCII export,  Next: HTML export,  Prev: The export dispatcher,  Up: Exporting

12.5 ASCII export
=================

ASCII export produces a simple and very readable version of an Org-mode
file.

`C-c C-e a'
     Export as ASCII file.  For an Org file, `myfile.org', the ASCII
     file will be `myfile.txt'.  The file will be overwritten without
     warning.  If there is an active region(1), only the region will be
     exported. If the selected region is a single tree(2), the tree
     head will become the document title.  If the tree head entry has
     or inherits an `EXPORT_FILE_NAME' property, that name will be used
     for the export.  

`C-c C-e A'
     Export to a temporary buffer, do not create a file.  

`C-c C-e v a'
     Export only the visible part of the document.

   In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as itemized lists.  If you want that transition to
occur at a different level, specify it with a prefix argument.  For
example,

     C-1 C-c C-e a

creates only top level headlines and does the rest as items.  When
headlines are converted to items, the indentation of the text following
the headline is changed to fit nicely under the item.  This is done with
the assumption that the first body line indicates the base indentation
of the body text.  Any indentation larger than this is adjusted to
preserve the layout relative to the first line.  Should there be lines
with less indentation than the first, these are left alone.

   Links will be exported in a footnote-like style, with the
descriptive part in the text and the link in a note before the next
heading.  See the variable `org-export-ascii-links-to-notes' for
details and other options.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This requires `transient-mark-mode' be turned on.

   (2) To select the current subtree, use `C-c @'.

but with additional support for tables.

File: org,  Node: HTML Export commands,  Next: Quoting HTML tags,  Prev: HTML export,  Up: HTML export

12.6.1 HTML export commands
---------------------------

`C-c C-e h'
     Export as HTML file `myfile.html'.  For an Org file `myfile.org',
     the ASCII file will be `myfile.html'.  The file will be overwritten
     without warning.  If there is an active region(1), only the region
     will be exported. If the selected region is a single tree(2), the
     tree head will become the document title.  If the tree head entry
     has, or inherits, an `EXPORT_FILE_NAME' property, that name will
     be used for the export.  

`C-c C-e b'
     Export as HTML file and immediately open it with a browser.  

`C-c C-e H'
     Export to a temporary buffer, do not create a file.  

`C-c C-e R'
     Export the active region to a temporary buffer.  With a prefix
     argument, do not produce the file header and footer, but just the
     plain HTML section for the region.  This is good for cut-and-paste
     operations.  

`C-c C-e v h'

`C-c C-e v b'

`C-c C-e v H'

`C-c C-e v R'
     Export only the visible part of the document.

`M-x org-export-region-as-html'
     Convert the region to HTML under the assumption that it was
     Org-mode syntax before.  This is a global command that can be
     invoked in any buffer.

`M-x org-replace-region-by-HTML'
     Replace the active region (assumed to be in Org-mode syntax) by
     HTML code.

   In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as itemized lists.  If you want that transition to
occur at a different level, specify it with a numeric prefix argument.
For example,

     C-2 C-c C-e b

creates two levels of headings and does the rest as items.

File: org,  Node: Quoting HTML tags,  Next: Links,  Prev: HTML Export commands,  Up: HTML export

12.6.2 Quoting HTML tags
------------------------

Plain `<' and `>' are always transformed to `&lt;' and `&gt;' in HTML
export.  If you want to include simple HTML tags which should be
interpreted as such, mark them with `@' as in `@<b>bold text@</b>'.
Note that this really works only for simple tags.  For more extensive
HTML that should be copied verbatim to the exported file use either

     #+HTML: Literal HTML code for export

or 

     #+BEGIN_HTML
     All lines between these markers are exported literally
     #+END_HTML


File: org,  Node: Links,  Next: Tables in HTML export,  Prev: Quoting HTML tags,  Up: HTML export

12.6.3 Links
------------

Internal links (*note Internal links::) will continue to work in HTML.
This includes automatic links created by radio targets (*note Radio
targets::).  Links to external files will still work if the target file
is on the same relative path as the published Org file.  Links to other
`.org' files will be translated into HTML links under the assumption
that an HTML version also exists of the linked file, at the same
relative path.  `id:' links can then be used to jump to specific
entries across files.  For information related to linking files while
publishing them to a publishing directory see *note Publishing links::.

   If you want to specify attributes for links, you can do so using a
special `#+ATTR_HTML' line to define attributes that will be added to
the `<a>' or `<img>' tags.  Here is an example that sets `title' and
`style' attributes for a link:

     #+ATTR_HTML: title="The Org-mode homepage" style="color:red;"
     [[http://orgmode.org]]


File: org,  Node: Tables in HTML export,  Next: Images in HTML export,  Prev: Links,  Up: HTML export

12.6.4 Tables
-------------

Org-mode tables are exported to HTML using the table tag defined in
`org-export-html-table-tag'.  The default setting makes tables without
cell borders and frame.  If you would like to change this for individual
tables, place somthing like the following before the table:

     #+CAPTION: This is a table with lines around and between cells
     #+ATTR_HTML: border="2" rules="all" frame="all"


File: org,  Node: Images in HTML export,  Next: Text areas in HTML export,  Prev: Tables in HTML export,  Up: HTML export

12.6.5 Images
-------------

HTML export can inline images given as links in the Org file, and it
can make an image the clickable part of a link.  By default(1), images
are inlined if a link does not have a description.  So
`[[file:myimg.jpg]]' will be inlined, while `[[file:myimg.jpg][the
image]]' will just produce a link `the image' that points to the image.
If the description part itself is a `file:' link or a `http:' URL
pointing to an image, this image will be inlined and activated so that
clicking on the image will activate the link.  For example, to include
a thumbnail that will link to a high resolution version of the image,
you could use:

     [[file:highres.jpg][file:thumb.jpg]]

   If you need to add attributes to an inlines image, use a
`#+ATTR_HTML', for example:

     #+CAPTION: A black cat stalking a spider
     #+ATTR_HTML: alt="cat/spider image" title="one second before action"
     [[./img/a.jpg]]

and you could use `http' addresses just as well.

File: org,  Node: Text areas in HTML export,  Next: CSS support,  Prev: Images in HTML export,  Up: HTML export

12.6.6 Text areas
-----------------

An alternative way to publish literal code examples in HTML is to use
text areas, where the example can even be edited before pasting it into
an application.  It is triggered by a `-t' switch at an `example' or
`src' block.  Using this switch disables any options for syntax and
label highlighting, and line numbering, which may be present.  You may
also use `-h' and `-w' switches to specify the height and width of the
text area, which default to the number of lines in the example, and 80,
respectively.  For example

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE -t -w 40
     (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Exclusive or."
        (if a (not b) b))
     #+END_EXAMPLE


File: org,  Node: CSS support,  Next: Javascript support,  Prev: Text areas in HTML export,  Up: HTML export

12.6.7 CSS support
------------------

You can also give style information for the exported file.  The HTML
exporter assigns the following special CSS classes(1) to appropriate
parts of the document--your style specifications may change these, in
addition to any of the standard classes like for headlines, tables, etc.
     p.author            author information, including email
     p.date              publishing date
     p.creator           creator info, about org-mode version
     .title              document title
     .todo               TODO keywords, all not-done states
     .done               the DONE keywords, all stated the count as done
     .WAITING            each TODO keyword also uses a class named after itself
     .timestamp          timestamp
     .timestamp-kwd      keyword associated with a timestamp, like SCHEDULED
     .timestamp-wrapper  span around keyword plus timestamp
     .tag                tag in a headline
     ._HOME              each tag uses itself as a class, "@" replaced by "_"
     .target             target for links
     .linenr             the line number in a code example
     .code-highlighted   for highlighting referenced code lines
     div.outline-N       div for outline level N (headline plus text))
     div.outline-text-N  extra div for text at outline level N
     .section-number-N   section number in headlines, different for each level
     div.figure          how to format an inlined image
     pre.src             formatted source code
     pre.example         normal example
     p.verse             verse paragraph
     div.footnotes       footnote section headline
     p.footnote          footnote definition paragraph, containing a footnote
     .footref            a footnote reference number (always a <sup>)
     .footnum            footnote number in footnote definition (always <sup>)

   Each exported file contains a compact default style that defines
these classes in a basic way(2).  You may overwrite these settings, or
add to them by using the variables `org-export-html-style' (for
Org-wide settings) and `org-export-html-style-extra' (for more granular
settings, like file-local settings).  To set the latter variable
individually for each file, you can use

     #+STYLE: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" />

For longer style definitions, you can use several such lines.  You
could also directly write a `<style>' `</style>' section in this way,
without referring to an external file.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the classes on TODO keywords and tags lead to conflicts, use
the variables `org-export-html-todo-kwd-class-prefix' and
`org-export-html-tag-class-prefix' to make them unique.

   (2) This style is defined in the constant
`org-export-html-style-default', which you should not modify.  To turn
inclusion of these defaults off, customize
`org-export-html-style-include-default'


File: org,  Node: Javascript support,  Prev: CSS support,  Up: HTML export

12.6.8 Javascript supported display of web pages
------------------------------------------------

Sebastian Rose has written a JavaScript program especially designed to
enhance the web viewing experience of HTML files created with Org.  This
program allows you to view large files in two different ways.  The
first one is an _Info_-like mode where each section is displayed
separately and navigation can be done with the `n' and `p' keys (and
some other keys as well, press `?' for an overview of the available
keys).  The second view type is a _folding_ view much like Org provides
inside Emacs.  The script is available at
`http://orgmode.org/org-info.js' and you can find the documentation for
it at `http://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/'.  We host the script
at our site, but if you use it a lot, you might not want to be
dependent on `orgmode.org' and prefer to install a local copy on your
own web server.

   To use the script, you need to make sure that the `org-jsinfo.el'
module gets loaded.  It should be loaded by default, but you can try
`M-x customize-variable <RET> org-modules <RET>' to convince yourself
that this is indeed the case.  All it then takes to make use of the
program is adding a single line to the Org file:

     #+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil

If this line is found, the HTML header will automatically contain the
code needed to invoke the script.  Using the line above, you can set
the following viewing options:

     path:    The path to the script.  The default is to grab the script from
              `http://orgmode.org/org-info.js', but you might want to have
              a local copy and use a path like `../scripts/org-info.js'.
     view:    Initial view when website is first shown.  Possible values are:
              info      Info-like interface with one section per page.
              overview  Folding interface, initially showing only top-level.
              content   Folding interface, starting with all headlines visible.
              showall   Folding interface, all headlines and text visible.
     sdepth:  Maximum headline level that will still become an independent
              section for info and folding modes.  The default is taken from
              `org-export-headline-levels' (= the `H' switch in `#+OPTIONS').
              If this is smaller than in `org-export-headline-levels', each
              info/folding section can still contain child headlines.
     toc:     Should the table of content _initially_ be visible?
              Even when `nil', you can always get to the "toc" with `i'.
     tdepth:  The depth of the table of contents.  The defaults are taken from
              the variables `org-export-headline-levels' and `org-export-with-toc'.
     ftoc:    Does the css of the page specify a fixed position for the "toc"?
              If yes, the toc will never be displayed as a section.
     ltoc:    Should there be short contents (children) in each section?
              Make this `above' if the section should be above initial text.
     mouse:   Headings are highlighted when the mouse is over them.  Should be
              `underline' (default) or a background color like `#cccccc'.
     buttons: Should view-toggle buttons be everywhere?  When `nil' (the
              default), only one such button will be present.
   You can choose default values for these options by customizing the
variable `org-infojs-options'.  If you always want to apply the script
to your pages, configure the variable `org-export-html-use-infojs'.

12.7 LaTeX and PDF export
=========================

Org mode contains a LaTeX exporter written by Bastien Guerry.  With
further processing, this backend is also used to produce PDF output.
Since the LaTeX output uses `hyperref' to implement links and cross
references, the PDF output file will be fully linked.

12.7.1 LaTeX export commands
----------------------------

`C-c C-e l'
     Export as LaTeX file `myfile.tex'.  For an Org file `myfile.org',
     the ASCII file will be `myfile.tex'.  The file will be overwritten
     without warning.  If there is an active region(1), only the region
     will be exported. If the selected region is a single tree(2), the
     tree head will become the document title.  If the tree head entry
     has or inherits an `EXPORT_FILE_NAME' property, that name will be
     used for the export.  

`C-c C-e L'
     Export to a temporary buffer, do not create a file.  

`C-c C-e v l'

`C-c C-e v L'
     Export only the visible part of the document.

`M-x org-export-region-as-latex'
     Convert the region to LaTeX under the assumption that it was Org
     mode syntax before.  This is a global command that can be invoked
     in any buffer.

`M-x org-replace-region-by-latex'
     Replace the active region (assumed to be in Org mode syntax) by
     LaTeX code.  

`C-c C-e p'
     Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF.  

`C-c C-e d'
     Export as LaTeX and then process to PDF, then open the resulting
     PDF file.

   In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as description lists.  The exporter can ignore them or
convert them to a custom string depending on `org-latex-low-levels'.

   If you want that transition to occur at a different level, specify it
with a numeric prefix argument. For example,

     C-2 C-c C-e l

creates two levels of headings and does the rest as items.

12.7.2 Quoting LaTeX code
-------------------------

Embedded LaTeX as described in *note Embedded LaTeX::, will be correctly
inserted into the LaTeX file.  This includes simple macros like
`\ref{LABEL}' to create a cross reference to a figure.  Furthermore,
you can add special code that should only be present in LaTeX export
with the following constructs:

     #+LaTeX: Literal LaTeX code for export

or 

     #+BEGIN_LaTeX
     All lines between these markers are exported literally
     #+END_LaTeX

12.7.3 Sectioning structure
---------------------------

By default, the LaTeX output uses the class `article'.

   You can change this globally by setting a different value for
`org-export-latex-default-class' or locally by adding an option like
`#+LaTeX_CLASS: myclass' in your file, or with a `:LaTeX_CLASS:'
property that applies when exporting a region containing only this
(sub)tree.  The class should be listed in `org-export-latex-classes',
where you can also define the sectioning structure for each class, as
well as defining additional classes.  You can also use `#+LATEX_HEADER:
\usepackage{xyz}' to add lines to the header.

12.7.4 Tables in LaTeX export
-----------------------------

For LaTeX export of a table, you can specify a label and a caption
(*note Markup rules::).  You can also use the `ATTR_LaTeX' line to
request a longtable environment for the table, so that it may span
several pages.  Finally, you can set the alignment string:

     #+CAPTION: A long table
     #+LABEL: tbl:long
     #+ATTR_LaTeX: longtable align=l|lp{3cm}r|l
     | ..... | ..... |
     | ..... | ..... |

12.7.5 Images in LaTeX export
-----------------------------

Images that are linked to without a description part in the link, like
`[[file:img.jpg]]' or `[[./img.jpg]]' will be inserted into the PDF
output files resulting from LaTeX output.  Org will use an
`\includegraphics' macro to insert the image.  If you have specified a
caption and/or a label as described in *note Markup rules::, the figure
will be wrapped into a `figure' environment and thus become a floating
element.  Finally, you can use an `#+ATTR_LaTeX:' line to specify the
options that can be used in the optional argument of the
`\includegraphics' macro.

     #+CAPTION:    The black-body emission of the disk around HR 4049
     #+LABEL:      fig:SED-HR4049
     #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=5cm,angle=90
     [[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]

   If you need references to a label created in this way, write
`\ref{fig:SED-HR4049}' just like in LaTeX.  The default settings will
recognize files types that can be included as images during processing
by `pdflatex' (`png', `jpg', and `pdf' files).  If you process your
files in a different way, you may need to customize the variable
`org-export-latex-inline-image-extensions'.

12.8 DocBook export
===================

Org contains a DocBook exporter written by Baoqiu Cui.  Once an Org
file is exported to DocBook format, it can be further processed to
produce other formats, including PDF, HTML, man pages, etc., using many
available DocBook tools and stylesheets.

   Currently DocBook exporter only supports DocBook V5.0.

File: org,  Node: DocBook export commands,  Next: Quoting DocBook code,  Prev: DocBook export,  Up: DocBook export

12.8.1 DocBook export commands
------------------------------

`C-c C-e D'
     Export as DocBook file.  For an Org file, `myfile.org', the
     DocBook XML file will be `myfile.xml'.  The file will be
     overwritten without warning.  If there is an active region(1),
     only the region will be exported.  If the selected region is a
     single tree(2), the tree head will become the document title.  If
     the tree head entry has, or inherits, an `EXPORT_FILE_NAME'
     property, that name will be used for the export.  

`C-c C-e V'
     Export as DocBook file, process to PDF, then open the resulting
     PDF file.

     Note that, in order to produce PDF output based on exported
     DocBook file, you need to have XSLT processor and XSL-FO processor
     software installed on your system.  Check variables
     `org-export-docbook-xslt-proc-command' and
     `org-export-docbook-xsl-fo-proc-command'.

`C-c C-e v D'
     Export only the visible part of the document.

12.8.2 Quoting DocBook code
---------------------------

You can quote DocBook code in Org files and copy it verbatim into
exported DocBook file with the following constructs:

     #+DOCBOOK: Literal DocBook code for export

or 

     #+BEGIN_DOCBOOK
     All lines between these markers are exported by DocBook exporter
     literally.
     #+END_DOCBOOK

   For example, you can use the following lines to include a DocBook
warning admonition.  As to what this warning says, you should pay
attention to the document context when quoting DocBook code in Org
files.  You may make exported DocBook XML files invalid by not quoting
DocBook code correctly.

     #+BEGIN_DOCBOOK
     <warning>
       <para>You should know what you are doing when quoting DocBook XML code
       in your Org file.  Invalid DocBook XML file may be generated by
       DocBook exporter if you are not careful!</para>
     </warning>
     #+END_DOCBOOK

12.8.3 Recursive sections
-------------------------

DocBook exporter exports Org files as articles using the `article'
element in DocBook.  Recursive sections, i.e., used in exported
articles.  Top level headlines in Org files are exported as top level
sections, and lower level headlines are exported as nested sections.
The entire structure of Org files will be exported completely, no
matter how many nested levels of headlines there are.

   Using recursive sections makes it easy to port and reuse exported
DocBook code in other DocBook document types like `book' or `set'.

12.8.4 Tables in DocBook export
-------------------------------

Tables in Org files are exported as HTML tables, which have been
supported since DocBook V4.3.

   If a table does not have a caption, an informal table is generated
using the `informaltable' element; otherwise, a formal table will be
generated using the `table' element.


File: org,  Node: Images in DocBook export,  Next: Special characters,  Prev: Tables in DocBook export,  Up: DocBook export

12.8.5 Images in DocBook export
-------------------------------

Images that are linked to without a description part in the link, like
`[[file:img.jpg]]' or `[[./img.jpg]]', will be exported to DocBook
using `mediaobject' elements.  Each `mediaobject' element contains an
`imageobject' that wraps an `imagedata' element.  If you have specified
a caption for an image as described in *note Markup rules::, a
`caption' element will be added in `mediaobject'.  If a label is also
specified, it will be exported as an `xml:id' attribute of the
`mediaobject' element.

   Image attributes supported by the `imagedata' element, like `align'
or `width', can be specified in two ways: you can either customize
variable `org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes' or use the
`#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:' line.  Attributes specified in variable
`org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes' are applied to all inline
images in the Org file to be exported (unless they are overwritten by
image attributes specified in `#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:' lines).

   The `#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:' line can be used to specify additional image
attributes or overwrite default image attributes for individual images.
If the same attribute appears in both the `#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:' line and
variable `org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes', the former
overwrites the latter.  Here is an example about how image attributes
can be set:

     #+CAPTION:    The logo of Org mode
     #+LABEL:      unicorn-svg
     #+ATTR_DOCBOOK: scalefit="1" width="100%" depth="100%"
     [[./img/org-mode-unicorn.svg]]

   By default, DocBook exporter recognizes the following image file
types: `jpeg', `jpg', `png', `gif', and `svg'.  You can customize
variable `org-export-docbook-inline-image-extensions' to add more types
to this list as long as DocBook supports them.


File: org,  Node: Special characters,  Prev: Images in DocBook export,  Up: DocBook export

12.8.6 Special characters in DocBook export
-------------------------------------------

Special characters that are written in TeX-like syntax, such as
`\alpha', `\Gamma', and `\Zeta', are supported by DocBook exporter.
These characters are rewritten to XML entities, like `&alpha;',
`&Gamma;', and `&Zeta;', based on the list saved in variable
`org-html-entities'.  As long as the generated DocBook file includes the
corresponding entities, these special characters are recognized.

   You can customize variable `org-export-docbook-doctype' to include
the entities you need.  For example, you can set variable
`org-export-docbook-doctype' to the following value to recognize all
special characters included in XHTML entities:

     "<!DOCTYPE article [
     <!ENTITY % xhtml1-symbol PUBLIC
     \"-//W3C//ENTITIES Symbol for HTML//EN//XML\"
     \"http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/xhtml1-symbol.ent\"
     >
     %xhtml1-symbol;

12.9 XOXO export
================

Org mode contains an exporter that produces XOXO-style output.
Currently, this exporter only handles the general outline structure and
does not interpret any additional Org-mode features.

`C-c C-e x'
     Export as XOXO file `myfile.html'.  

`C-c C-e v x'
     Export only the visible part of the document.


File: org,  Node: iCalendar export,  Prev: XOXO export,  Up: Exporting

12.10 iCalendar export
======================

Some people use Org mode for keeping track of projects, but still
prefer a standard calendar application for anniversaries and
appointments.  In this case it can be useful to show deadlines and
other time-stamped items in Org files in the calendar application.  Org
mode can export calendar information in the standard iCalendar format.
If you also want to have TODO entries included in the export, configure
the variable `org-icalendar-include-todo'.  Plain timestamps are
exported as VEVENT, and TODO items as VTODO.  It will also create
events from deadlines that are in non-TODO items.  Deadlines and
scheduling dates in TODO items will be used to set the start and due
dates for the TODO entry(1).  As categories, it will use the tags
locally defined in the heading, and the file/tree category(2).

   The iCalendar standard requires each entry to have a globally unique
identifier (UID).  Org creates these identifiers during export.  If you
set the variable `org-icalendar-store-UID', the UID will be stored in
the `:ID:' property of the entry and re-used next time you report this
entry.  Since a single entry can give rise to multiple iCalendar
entries (as a timestamp, a deadline, a scheduled item, and as a TODO
item), Org adds prefixes to the UID, depending on what triggered the
inclusion of the entry.  In this way the UID remains unique, but a
synchronization program can still figure out from which entry all the
different instances originate.

`C-c C-e i'
     Create iCalendar entries for the current file and store them in
     the same directory, using a file extension `.ics'.  

`C-c C-e I'
     Like `C-c C-e i', but do this for all files in `org-agenda-files'.
     For each of these files, a separate iCalendar file will be written.  

`C-c C-e c'
     Create a single large iCalendar file from all files in
     `org-agenda-files' and write it to the file given by
     `org-combined-agenda-icalendar-file'.

   The export will honor SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION(3)
properties if the selected entries have them.  If not, the summary will
be derived from the headline, and the description from the body
(limited to `org-icalendar-include-body' characters).

   How this calendar is best read and updated, depends on the
application you are using.  The FAQ covers this issue.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variables `org-icalendar-use-deadline' and
`org-icalendar-use-scheduled'.

   (2) To add inherited tags or the TODO state, configure the variable
`org-icalendar-categories'.

   (3) The LOCATION property can be inherited from higher in the
hierarchy if you configure `org-use-property-inheritance' accordingly.

13 Publishing
*************

Org includes a publishing management system that allows you to configure
automatic HTML conversion of _projects_ composed of interlinked org
files.  You can also configure Org to automatically upload your
exported HTML pages and related attachments, such as images and source
code files, to a web server.

   You can also use Org to convert files into PDF, or even combine HTML
and PDF conversion so that files are available in both formats on the
server.

   Publishing has been contributed to Org by David O'Toole.

13.1 Configuration
==================

Publishing needs significant configuration to specify files, destination
and many other properties of a project.

* Sources and destinations::    From here to there
* Selecting files::             What files are part of the project?

* Project page index::          Publishing a list of project files


File: org,  Node: Project alist,  Next: Sources and destinations,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Configuration

13.1.1 The variable `org-publish-project-alist'
-----------------------------------------------

Publishing is configured almost entirely through setting the value of
one variable, called `org-publish-project-alist'.  Each element of the
list configures one project, and may be in one of the two following
forms:

        ("project-name" :property value :property value ...)
     or
        ("project-name" :components ("project-name" "project-name" ...))

   In both cases, projects are configured by specifying property
values.  A project defines the set of files that will be published, as
well as the publishing configuration to use when publishing those
files.  When a project takes the second form listed above, the
individual members of the `:components' property are taken to be
sub-projects, which group together files requiring different publishing
options.  When you publish such a "meta-project", all the components
will also be published, in the sequence given.


File: org,  Node: Sources and destinations,  Next: Selecting files,  Prev: Project alist,  Up: Configuration

13.1.2 Sources and destinations for files
-----------------------------------------

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set.  In
particular, Org needs to know where to look for source files, and where
to put published files.

`:base-directory'      Directory containing publishing source files
`:publishing-directory'Directory where output files will be published.
                       You can directly publish to a webserver using a
                       file name syntax appropriate for the Emacs
                       `tramp' package.  Or you can publish to a local
                       directory and use external tools to upload your
                       website (*note Uploading files::).
`:preparation-function'Function called before starting the publishing
                       process, for example, to run `make' for updating
                       files to be published.
`:completion-function' Function called after finishing the publishing
                       process, for example, to change permissions of
                       the resulting files.


File: org,  Node: Selecting files,  Next: Publishing action,  Prev: Sources and destinations,  Up: Configuration

13.1.3 Selecting files
----------------------

By default, all files with extension `.org' in the base directory are
considered part of the project.  This can be modified by setting the
properties
`:base-extension'  Extension (without the dot!) of source files.  This
                   actually is a regular expression.  Set this to the
                   symbol `any' if you want to get all files in
                   `:base-directory', even without extension.
`:exclude'         Regular expression to match file names that should
                   not be published, even though they have been selected
                   on the basis of their extension.
`:include'         List of files to be included regardless of
                   `:base-extension' and `:exclude'.


File: org,  Node: Publishing action,  Next: Publishing options,  Prev: Selecting files,  Up: Configuration

13.1.4 Publishing action
------------------------

Publishing means that a file is copied to the destination directory and
possibly transformed in the process.  The default transformation is to
export Org files as HTML files, and this is done by the function
`org-publish-org-to-html' which calls the HTML exporter (*note HTML
export::).  But you also can publish your content as PDF files using
`org-publish-org-to-pdf'.  If you want to publish the Org file itself,
but with archived, commented, and tag-excluded trees removed, use
`org-publish-org-to-org' and set the parameters `:plain-source' and/or
`:htmlized-source'.  This will produce `file.org' and `file.org.html'
in the publishing directory(1).  Other files like images only need to
be copied to the publishing destination, for this you may use
`org-publish-attachment'.  For non-Org files, you always need to
specify the publishing function:

`:publishing-function' Function executing the publication of a file.
                       This may also be a list of functions, which will
                       all be called in turn.
`:plain-source'        Non-nil means, publish plain source.
`:htmlized-source'     Non-nil means, publish htmlized source.

   The function must accept two arguments: a property list containing
at least a `:publishing-directory' property, and the name of the file
to be published.  It should take the specified file, make the necessary
transformation (if any) and place the result into the destination
folder.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `file-source.org' and `file-source.org.html' if source and
publishing directories are equal.  Note that with this kind of setup,
you need to add `:exclude "-source\\.org"' to the project definition in
`org-publish-project-alist' to avoid that the published source files
will be considered as new org files the next time the project is
published.

`:select-tags'          `org-export-select-tags'
`:exclude-tags'         `org-export-exclude-tags'
`:latex-image-options'  `org-export-latex-image-default-option'

   Most of the `org-export-with-*' variables have the same effect in
both HTML and LaTeX exporters, except for `:TeX-macros' and
`:LaTeX-fragments', respectively `nil' and `t' in the LaTeX export.

   When a property is given a value in `org-publish-project-alist', its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable (if any)
during publishing.  Options set within a file (*note Export options::),
however, override everything.


File: org,  Node: Publishing links,  Next: Project page index,  Prev: Publishing options,  Up: Configuration

13.1.6 Links between published files
------------------------------------

To create a link from one Org file to another, you would use something
like `[[file:foo.org][The foo]]' or simply `file:foo.org.' (*note
Hyperlinks::).  When published, this link becomes a link to `foo.html'.
In this way, you can interlink the pages of your "org web" project and
the links will work as expected when you publish them to HTML.  If you
also publish the Org source file and want to link to that, use an
`http:' link instead of a `file:' link, because `file:' links are
converted to link to the corresponding `html' file.

   You may also link to related files, such as images. Provided you are
careful with relative file names, and provided you have also configured
Org to upload the related files, these links will work too. See *note
Complex example::, for an example of this usage.

   Sometimes an Org file to be published may contain links that are
only valid in your production environment, but not in the publishing
location.  In this case, use the property

`:link-validation-function'   Function to validate links

to define a function for checking link validity.  This function must
accept two arguments, the file name and a directory relative to which
the file name is interpreted in the production environment.  If this
function returns `nil', then the HTML generator will only insert a
description into the HTML file, but no link.  One option for this
function is `org-publish-validate-link' which checks if the given file
is part of any project in `org-publish-project-alist'.


File: org,  Node: Project page index,  Prev: Publishing links,  Up: Configuration

13.1.7 Project page index
-------------------------

The following properties may be used to control publishing of an index
of files or a summary page for a given project.

`:auto-index'      When non-nil, publish an index during
                   `org-publish-current-project' or `org-publish-all'.
`:index-filename'  Filename for output of index. Defaults to
                   `sitemap.org' (which becomes `sitemap.html').
`:index-title'     Title of index page. Defaults to name of file.
`:index-function'  Plug-in function to use for generation of index.
                   Defaults to `org-publish-org-index', which generates
                   a plain list of links to all files in the project.

13.2 Uploading files
====================

For those people already utilizing third party sync tools such as
`rsync' or `unison', it might be preferable not to use the built in
remote publishing facilities of Org mode which rely heavily on Tramp.
Tramp, while very useful and powerful, tends not to be so efficient for
multiple file transfer and has been known to cause problems under heavy
usage.

   Specialized synchronization utilities offer several advantages.  In
addition to timestamp comparison, they also do content and
permissions/attribute checks.  For this reason you might prefer to
publish your web to a local directory (possibly even in place with your
Org files) and then use `unison' or `rsync' to do the synchronization
with the remote host.

   Since Unison (for example) can be configured as to which files to
transfer to a certain remote destination, it can greatly simplify the
project publishing definition.  Simply keep all files in the correct
location, process your Org files with `org-publish' and let the
synchronization tool do the rest.  You do not need, in this scenario,
to include attachments such as `jpg', `css' or `gif' files in the
project definition since the 3rd party tool syncs them.

   Publishing to a local directory is also much faster than to a remote
one, so that you can afford more easily to republish entire projects.
If you set `org-publish-use-timestamps-flag' to `nil', you gain the main
benefit of re-including any changed external files such as source
example files you might include with `#+INCLUDE'.  The timestamp
mechanism in Org is not smart enough to detect if included files have
been modified.

13.3 Sample configuration
=========================

Below we provide two example configurations.  The first one is a simple
project publishing only a set of Org files.  The second example is more
complex, with a multi-component project.

13.3.1 Example: simple publishing configuration
-----------------------------------------------

This example publishes a set of Org files to the `public_html'
directory on the local machine.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("org"
              :base-directory "~/org/"
              :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
              :section-numbers nil
              :table-of-contents nil
              :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                     href=\"../other/mystyle.css\"
                     type=\"text/css\"/>")))


File: org,  Node: Complex example,  Prev: Simple example,  Up: Sample configuration

13.3.2 Example: complex publishing configuration
------------------------------------------------

This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including
Org files converted to HTML, image files, Emacs Lisp source code, and
style sheets. The publishing directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

   To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths. For example, if your Org files are kept in `~/org' and your
publishable images in `~/images', you'd link to an image with
     file:../images/myimage.png
   On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the
same. You can accomplish this by setting up an "images" folder in the
right place on the web server, and publishing images to it.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("orgfiles"
               :base-directory "~/org/"
               :base-extension "org"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/notebook/"

               :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                       href=\"../other/mystyle.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>"
               :auto-preamble t
               :auto-postamble nil)

              ("images"
               :base-directory "~/images/"
               :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/images/"
               :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

              ("other"
               :base-directory "~/other/"
               :base-extension "css\\|el"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/other/"
               :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
              ("website" :components ("orgfiles" "images" "other"))))

13.4 Triggering publication
===========================

Once properly configured, Org can publish with the following commands:

`C-c C-e C'
     Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to
     it.  

`C-c C-e P'
     Publish the project containing the current file.  

`C-c C-e F'
     Publish only the current file.  

`C-c C-e E'
     Publish every project.

   Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed. The above
functions normally only publish changed files. You can override this
and force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument to any of
the commands above, or by customizing the variable
`org-publish-use-timestamps-flag'.  This may be necessary in particular
if files include other files via `#+SETUPFILE:' or `#+INCLUDE:'.

14.1 Completion
===============

Emacs would not be Emacs without completion, and Org-mode uses it
whenever it makes sense.  If you prefer an iswitchb- or ido-like
interface for some of the completion prompts, you can specify your
preferece by setting at most one of the variables
`org-completion-use-iswitchb' `org-completion-use-ido'.

   Org supports in-buffer completion.  This type of completion does not
make use of the minibuffer.  You simply type a few letters into the
buffer and use the key to complete text right there.

`M-<TAB>'
     Complete word at point
        * At the beginning of a headline, complete TODO keywords.

        * After `\', complete TeX symbols supported by the exporter.

        * After `*', complete headlines in the current buffer so that
          they can be used in search links like `[[*find this
          headline]]'.

        * After `:' in a headline, complete tags.  The list of tags is
          taken from the variable `org-tag-alist' (possibly set through
          the `#+TAGS' in-buffer option, *note Setting tags::), or it
          is created dynamically from all tags used in the current
          buffer.

        * After `:' and not in a headline, complete property keys.  The
          list of keys is constructed dynamically from all keys used in
          the current buffer.

        * After `[', complete link abbreviations (*note Link
          abbreviations::).

        * After `#+', complete the special keywords like `TYP_TODO' or
          `OPTIONS' which set file-specific options for Org mode.  When
          the option keyword is already complete, pressing `M-<TAB>'
          again will insert example settings for this keyword.

        * In the line after `#+STARTUP: ', complete startup keywords,
          i.e.,

        * Elsewhere, complete dictionary words using Ispell.

14.2 Customization
==================

There are more than 180 variables that can be used to customize Org.
For the sake of compactness of the manual, I am not describing the
variables here.  A structured overview of customization variables is
available with `M-x org-customize'.  Or select `Browse Org Group' from
the `Org->Customization' menu.  Many settings can also be activated on
a per-file basis, by putting special lines into the buffer (*note
In-buffer settings::).

14.3 Summary of in-buffer settings
==================================

Org mode uses special lines in the buffer to define settings on a
per-file basis.  These lines start with a `#+' followed by a keyword, a
colon, and then individual words defining a setting.  Several setting
words can be in the same line, but you can also have multiple lines for
the keyword.  While these settings are described throughout the manual,
here is a summary.  After changing any of those lines in the buffer,
press `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the line to activate the
changes immediately.  Otherwise they become effective only when the
file is visited again in a new Emacs session.

`#+ARCHIVE: %s_done::'
     This line sets the archive location for the agenda file.  It
     applies for all subsequent lines until the next `#+ARCHIVE' line,
     or the end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any
     entries before it.  The corresponding variable is
     `org-archive-location'.

`#+CATEGORY:'
     This line sets the category for the agenda file.  The category
     applies for all subsequent lines until the next `#+CATEGORY' line,
     or the end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any
     entries before it.

`#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM .....'
     Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
     columns view is invoked in locations where no `COLUMNS' property
     applies.

`#+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...'
     Set file-local values for constants to be used in table formulas.
     This line set the local variable
     `org-table-formula-constants-local'.  The global version of this
     variable is `org-table-formula-constants'.

`#+FILETAGS: :tag1:tag2:tag3:'
     Set tags that can be inherited by any entry in the file, including
     the top-level entries.

`#+DRAWERS: NAME1 .....'
     Set the file-local set of drawers.  The corresponding global
     variable is `org-drawers'.

`#+LINK:  linkword replace'
     These lines (several are allowed) specify link abbreviations.
     *Note Link abbreviations::.  The corresponding variable is
     `org-link-abbrev-alist'.

`#+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default'
     This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All
     three must be either letters A-Z or numbers 0-9.  The highest
     priority must have a lower ASCII number that the lowest priority.

`#+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value'
     This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the
     current buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a
     property.  

`#+SETUPFILE: file'
     This line defines a file that holds more in-buffer setup.
     Normally this is entirely ignored.  Only when the buffer is parsed
     for option-setting lines (i.e., settings line, or when exporting),
     then the contents of this file are parsed as if they had been
     included in the buffer.  In particular, the file can be any other
     Org mode file with internal setup.  You can visit the file the
     cursor is in the line with `C-c ''.

`#+STARTUP:'
     This line sets options to be used at startup of Org mode, when an
     Org file is being visited.

     The first set of options deals with the initial visibility of the
     outline tree.  The corresponding variable for global default
     settings is `org-startup-folded', with a default value `t', which
     means `overview'.  
          overview         top-level headlines only
          content          all headlines
          showall          no folding of any entries
          showeverything   show even drawer contents

     Dynamic virtual indentation is controlled by the variable
     `org-startup-indented'(1)
          indent     start with `org-indent-mode' turned on
          noindent   start with `org-indent-mode' turned off

     Then there are options for aligning tables upon visiting a file.
     This is useful in files containing narrowed table columns.  The
     corresponding variable is `org-startup-align-all-tables', with a
     default value `nil'.  
          align      align all tables
          noalign    don't align tables on startup
     Logging the closing and reopening of TODO items and clock
     intervals can be configured using these options (see variables
     `org-log-done', `org-log-note-clock-out' and `org-log-repeat') 
          logdone            record a timestamp when an item is marked DONE
          lognotedone        record timestamp and a note when DONE
          nologdone          don't record when items are marked DONE
          logrepeat          record a time when reinstating a repeating item
          lognoterepeat      record a note when reinstating a repeating item
          nologrepeat        do not record when reinstating repeating item
          lognoteclock-out   record a note when clocking out
          nolognoteclock-out don't record a note when clocking out
     Here are the options for hiding leading stars in outline headings,
     and for indenting outlines.  The corresponding variables are
     `org-hide-leading-stars' and `org-odd-levels-only', both with a
     default setting `nil' (meaning `showstars' and `oddeven').  
          hidestars  make all but one of the stars starting a headline invisible.
          showstars  show all stars starting a headline
          indent     virtual indentation according to outline level
          noindent   no virtual indentation according to outline level
          odd        allow only odd outline levels (1,3,...)
          oddeven    allow all outline levels
     To turn on custom format overlays over timestamps (variables
     `org-put-time-stamp-overlays' and
     `org-time-stamp-overlay-formats'), use 
          customtime overlay custom time format
     The following options influence the table spreadsheet (variable
     `constants-unit-system').  
          constcgs   `constants.el' should use the c-g-s unit system
          constSI    `constants.el' should use the SI unit system
     To influence footnote settings, use the following keywords.  The
     corresponding variables are `org-footnote-define-inline',
     `org-footnote-auto-label', and `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.  
          fninline    define footnotes inline
          fnnoinline  define footnotes in separate section
          fnlocal     define footnotes near first reference, but not inline
          fnprompt    prompt for footnote labels
          fnauto      create [fn:1]-like labels automatically (default)
          fnconfirm   offer automatic label for editing or confirmation
          fnplain     create [1]-like labels automatically
          fnadjust    automatically renumber and sort footnotes
          nofnadjust  do not renumber and sort automatically
     To hide blocks on startup, use these keywords. The corresponding
     variable is `org-hide-block-startup'.  
          hideblocks   Hide all begin/end blocks on startup
          nohideblocks Do not hide blocks on startup

`#+TAGS:  TAG1(c1) TAG2(c2)'
     These lines (several such lines are allowed) specify the valid
     tags in this file, and (potentially) the corresponding _fast tag
     selection_ keys.  The corresponding variable is `org-tag-alist'.

`#+TBLFM:'
     This line contains the formulas for the table directly above the
     line.

`#+TITLE:, #+AUTHOR:, #+EMAIL:, #+LANGUAGE:, #+TEXT:, #+DATE:,'
`#+OPTIONS:, #+BIND:'
`#+DESCRIPTION:, #+KEYWORDS:'
`#+LATEX_HEADER:, #+STYLE:, #+LINK_UP:, #+LINK_HOME:,'
`#+EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS:, #+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS:'
     These lines provide settings for exporting files.  For more
     details see *note Export options::.

`#+TODO:    #+SEQ_TODO:   #+TYP_TODO:'
     These lines set the TODO keywords and their interpretation in the
     current file.  The corresponding variable is `org-todo-keywords'.

14.4 The very busy C-c C-c key
==============================

The key `C-c C-c' has many purposes in Org, which are all mentioned
scattered throughout this manual.  One specific function of this key is
to add _tags_ to a headline (*note Tags::).  In many other
circumstances it means something like _"Hey Org, look here and update
according to what you see here"_.  Here is a summary of what this means
in different contexts.

   - If there are highlights in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
     tree, or from clock display, remove these highlights.

   - If the cursor is in one of the special `#+KEYWORD' lines, this
     triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
     information.

   - If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
     works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.

   - If the cursor is on a `#+TBLFM' line, re-apply the formulas to the
     entire table.

   - If the cursor is inside a table created by the `table.el' package,
     activate that table.

   - If the current buffer is a Remember buffer, close the note and
     file it.  With a prefix argument, file it, without further
     interaction, to the default location.

   - If the cursor is on a `<<<target>>>', update radio targets and
     corresponding links in this buffer.

   - If the cursor is in a property line or at the start or end of a
     property drawer, offer property commands.

   - If the cursor is at a footnote reference, go to the corresponding
     definition, and vice versa.

   - If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it.

   - If the cursor is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the
     status of the checkbox.

   - If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
     ordered list.

   - If the cursor is on the `#+BEGIN' line of a dynamic block, the
     block is updated.

14.5 A cleaner outline view
===========================

Some people find it noisy and distracting that the Org headlines start
with a potentially large number of stars, and that text below the
headlines is not indented.  While this is no problem when writing a
_book-like_ document where the outline headings are really section
headings, in a more _list-oriented_ outline, indented structure is a
lot cleaner:

     * Top level headline             |    * Top level headline
     ** Second level                  |      * Second level
     *** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
     some text                        |          some text
     *** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
     more text                        |          more text
     * Another top level headline     |    * Another top level headline

If you are using at least Emacs 23.1.50.3 and version 6.29 of Org, this
kind of view can be achieved dynamically at display time using
`org-indent-mode'.  In this minor mode, all lines are prefixed for
display with the necessary amount of space.  Also headlines are
prefixed with additional stars, so that the amount of indentation
shifts by two(1) spaces per level.  All headline stars but the last one
are made invisible using the `org-hide' face(2) - see below under `2.'
for more information on how this works.  You can turn on
`org-indent-mode' for all files by customizing the variable
`org-startup-indented', or you can turn it on for individual files using

     #+STARTUP: indent

   If you want a similar effect in earlier version of Emacs and/or Org,
or if you want the indentation to be hard space characters so that the
plain text file looks as similar as possible to the Emacs display, Org
supports you in the following way:

  1. _Indentation of text below headlines_
     You may indent text below each headline to make the left boundary
     line up with the headline, like

          *** 3rd level
              more text, now indented

     Org supports this with paragraph filling, line wrapping, and
     structure editing(3), preserving or adapting the indentation as
     appropriate.

  2. _Hiding leading stars_
     You can modify the display in such a way that all leading stars
     become invisible.  To do this in a global way, configure the
     variable `org-hide-leading-stars' or change this on a per-file
     basis with

          #+STARTUP: hidestars
          #+STARTUP: showstars

     With hidden stars, the tree becomes:

          * Top level headline
           * Second level
            * 3rd level
            ...

     The leading stars are not truly replaced by whitespace, they are
     only fontified with the face `org-hide' that uses the background
     color as font color.  If you are not using either white or black
     background, you may have to customize this face to get the wanted
     effect.  Another possibility is to set this font such that the
     extra stars are almost invisible, for example using the color
     `grey90' on a white background.

  3. Things become cleaner still if you skip all the even levels and
     use only odd levels 1, 3, 5..., effectively adding two stars to go
     from one outline level to the next(4).  In this way we get the
     outline view shown at the beginning of this section.  In order to
     make the structure editing and export commands handle this
     convention correctly, configure the variable
     `org-odd-levels-only', or set this on a per-file basis with one of
     the following lines:

          #+STARTUP: odd
          #+STARTUP: oddeven

     You can convert an Org file from single-star-per-level to the
     double-star-per-level convention with `M-x
     org-convert-to-odd-levels RET' in that file.  The reverse
     operation is `M-x org-convert-to-oddeven-levels'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-indent-indentation-per-level'.

   (2) Turning on `org-indent-mode' sets `org-hide-leading-stars' to
`t' and `org-adapt-indentation' to `nil'.

   (3) See also the variable `org-adapt-indentation'.

targets, `LEVEL=2' will correspond to 3 stars, etc.

14.6 Using Org on a tty
=======================

Because Org contains a large number of commands, by default many of
Org's core commands are bound to keys that are generally not accessible
on a tty, such as the cursor keys (<left>, <right>, <up>, <down>),
<TAB> and <RET>, in particular when used together with modifiers like
<Meta> and/or <Shift>.  To access these commands on a tty when special
keys are unavailable, the following alternative bindings can be used.
The tty bindings below will likely be more cumbersome; you may find for
some of the bindings below that a customized workaround suits you
better.  For example, changing a timestamp is really only fun with
`S-<cursor>' keys, whereas on a tty you would rather use `C-c .' to
re-insert the timestamp.

Default     Alternative 1  Alternative 2
`S-<TAB>'   `C-u <TAB>'    
`M-<left>'  `C-c C-x l'    `<Esc> <left>'
`M-S-<left>'`C-c C-x L'

Org lives in the world of GNU Emacs and interacts in various ways with
other code out there.

14.7.1 Packages that Org cooperates with
----------------------------------------

`calc.el' by Dave Gillespie
     Org uses the Calc package for implementing spreadsheet
     functionality in its tables (*note The spreadsheet::).  Org checks
     for the availability of Calc by looking for the function
     `calc-eval' which will have been autoloaded during setup if Calc
     has been installed properly.  As of Emacs 22, Calc is part of the
     Emacs distribution.  Another possibility for interaction between
     the two packages is using Calc for embedded calculations. *Note
     Embedded Mode: (Calc)Embedded Mode.

`constants.el' by Carsten Dominik
     In a table formula (*note The spreadsheet::), it is possible to use
     names for natural constants or units.  Instead of defining your own
     constants in the variable `org-table-formula-constants', install
     the `constants' package which defines a large number of constants
     and units, and lets you use unit prefixes like `M' for `Mega',
     etc.  You will need version 2.0 of this package, available at
     `http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools'. Org checks for the
     function `constants-get', which has to be autoloaded in your
     setup.  See the installation instructions in the file
     `constants.el'.

`cdlatex.el' by Carsten Dominik
     Org mode can make use of the CDLaTeX package to efficiently enter
     LaTeX fragments into Org files.  See *note CDLaTeX mode::.

`imenu.el' by Ake Stenhoff and Lars Lindberg
     Imenu allows menu access to an index of items in a file.  Org mode
     supports Imenu--all you need to do to get the index is the
     following:
          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu")))
     By default the index is two levels deep--you can modify the depth
     using the option `org-imenu-depth'.

`remember.el' by John Wiegley
     Org cooperates with remember, see *note Remember::.  `Remember.el'
     is not part of Emacs, find it on the web.

`speedbar.el' by Eric M. Ludlam
     Speedbar is a package that creates a special frame displaying
     files and index items in files.  Org mode supports Speedbar and
     allows you to drill into Org files directly from the Speedbar.  It
     also allows you to restrict the scope of agenda commands to a file
     or a subtree by using the command `<' in the Speedbar frame.  

`table.el' by Takaaki Ota
     Complex ASCII tables with automatic line wrapping, column- and
     row-spanning, and alignment can be created using the Emacs table
     package by Takaaki Ota (`http://sourceforge.net/projects/table',
     and also part of Emacs 22).  When <TAB> or `C-c C-c' is pressed in
     such a table, Org mode will call `table-recognize-table' and move
     the cursor into the table.  Inside a table, the keymap of Org mode
     is inactive.  In order to execute Org mode-related commands, leave
     the table.

    `C-c C-c'
          Recognize `table.el' table.  Works when the cursor is in a
          table.el table.  

    `C-c ~'
          Insert a `table.el' table.  If there is already a table at
          point, this command converts it between the `table.el' format
          and the Org-mode format.  See the documentation string of the
          command `org-convert-table' for the restrictions under which
          this is possible.
     `table.el' is part of Emacs 22.

`footnote.el' by Steven L. Baur
     Org mode recognizes numerical footnotes as provided by this
     package.  However, Org mode also has its own footnote support
     (*note Footnotes::), which makes using `footnote.el' unnecessary.

14.7.2 Packages that lead to conflicts with Org mode
----------------------------------------------------

     In Emacs 23, `shift-selection-mode' is on by default, meaning that
     cursor motions combined with the shift key should start or enlarge
     regions.  This conflicts with the use of `S-<cursor>' commands in
     Org to change timestamps, TODO keywords, priorities, and item
     bullet types if the cursor is at such a location.  By default,
     `S-<cursor>' commands outside special contexts don't do anything,
     but you can customize the variable `org-support-shift-select'.
     Org mode then tries to accommodate shift selection by (i) using it
     outside of the special contexts where special commands apply, and
     by (ii) extending an existing active region even if the cursor
     moves across a special context.

`CUA.el' by Kim. F. Storm
     Key bindings in Org conflict with the `S-<cursor>' keys used by
     CUA mode (as well as `pc-select-mode' and `s-region-mode') to
     select and extend the region.  In fact, Emacs 23 has this built-in
     in the form of `shift-selection-mode', see previous paragraph.  If
     you are using Emacs 23, you probably don't want to use another
     package for this purpose.  However, if you prefer to leave these
     keys to a different package while working in Org mode, configure
     the variable `org-replace-disputed-keys'.  When set, Org will move
     the following key bindings in Org files, and in the agenda buffer
     (but not during date selection).

          S-UP      ->  M-p             S-DOWN     ->  M-n
          S-LEFT    ->  M--             S-RIGHT    ->  M-+
          C-S-LEFT  ->  M-S--           C-S-RIGHT  ->  M-S-+

     Yes, these are unfortunately more difficult to remember.  If you
     want to have other replacement keys, look at the variable
     `org-disputed-keys'.

`yasnippet.el'
     The way Org-mode binds the TAB key (binding to `[tab]' instead of
     `"\t"') overrules yasnippets' access to this key.  The following
     code fixed this problem:

          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          	  (lambda ()
          	    (org-set-local 'yas/trigger-key [tab])
          	    (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field-group)))

`windmove.el' by Hovav Shacham
     This package also uses the `S-<cursor>' keys, so everything written
     in the paragraph above about CUA mode also applies here.

A.1 Hooks
=========

Org has a large number of hook variables that can be used to add
functionality.  This appendix about hacking is going to illustrate the
use of some of them.  A complete list of all hooks with documentation is
maintained by the Worg project and can be found at
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-configs/org-hooks.php'.

A.2 Add-on packages
===================

A large number of add-on packages have been written by various authors.
These packages are not part of Emacs, but they are distributed as
contributed packages with the separate release available at the Org
mode home page at `http://orgmode.org'.  The list of contributed
packages, along with documentation about each package, is maintained by
the Worg project at `http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/'.

A.3 Adding hyperlink types
==========================

Org has a large number of hyperlink types built-in (*note
Hyperlinks::).  If you would like to add new link types, Org provides
an interface for doing so.  Let's look at an example file,
`org-man.el', that will add support for creating links like
`[[man:printf][The printf manpage]]' to show Unix manual pages inside
Emacs:

     ;;; org-man.el - Support for links to manpages in Org

     (require 'org)

     (org-add-link-type "man" 'org-man-open)
     (add-hook 'org-store-link-functions 'org-man-store-link)

     (defcustom org-man-command 'man
       "The Emacs command to be used to display a man page."
       :group 'org-link
       :type '(choice (const man) (const woman)))

     (defun org-man-open (path)
       "Visit the manpage on PATH.
     PATH should be a topic that can be thrown at the man command."
       (funcall org-man-command path))

     (defun org-man-store-link ()
       "Store a link to a manpage."
       (when (memq major-mode '(Man-mode woman-mode))
         ;; This is a man page, we do make this link
         (let* ((page (org-man-get-page-name))
                (link (concat "man:" page))
                (description (format "Manpage for %s" page)))
           (org-store-link-props
            :type "man"
            :link link
            :description description))))

     (defun org-man-get-page-name ()
       "Extract the page name from the buffer name."
       ;; This works for both `Man-mode' and `woman-mode'.
       (if (string-match " \\(\\S-+\\)\\*" (buffer-name))
           (match-string 1 (buffer-name))
         (error "Cannot create link to this man page")))

     (provide 'org-man)

     ;;; org-man.el ends here

You would activate this new link type in `.emacs' with

     (require 'org-man)

Let's go through the file and see what it does.
  1. It does `(require 'org)' to make sure that `org.el' has been
     loaded.

  2. The next line calls `org-add-link-type' to define a new link type
     with prefix `man'.  The call also contains the name of a function
     that will be called to follow such a link.

  3. The next line adds a function to `org-store-link-functions', in
     order to allow the command `C-c l' to record a useful link in a
     buffer displaying a man page.

   The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which Emacs
command should be used to display man pages.  There are two options,
`man' and `woman'.  Then the function to follow a link is defined.  It
gets the link path as an argument--in this case the link path is just a
topic for the manual command.  The function calls the value of
`org-man-command' to display the man page.

   Finally the function `org-man-store-link' is defined.  When you try
to store a link with `C-c l', this function will be called to try to
make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed to
create the link for this buffer type; we do this by checking the value
of the variable `major-mode'.  If not, the function must exit and
return the value `nil'.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual topic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
`man:'.  Then it must call the command `org-store-link-props' and set
the `:type' and `:link' properties.  Optionally you can also set the
`:description' property to provide a default for the link description
when the link is later inserted into an Org buffer with `C-c C-l'.

   When is makes sense for your new link type, you may also define a
function `org-PREFIX-complete-link' that implements special (e.g.,
support for inserting such a link with `C-c C-l'.  Such a function
should not accept any arguments, and return the full link with prefix.


File: org,  Node: Context-sensitive commands,  Next: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Prev: Adding hyperlink types,  Up: Hacking

A.4 Context-sensitive commands
==============================

Org has several commands that act differently depending on context.
The most important example it the `C-c C-c' (*note The very busy C-c
C-c key::).  Also the `M-cursor' and `M-S-cursor' keys have this
property.

   Add-ons can tap into this functionality by providing a function that
detects special context for that add-on and executes functionality
appropriate for the context.  Here is an example from Dan Davison's
`org-R.el' which allows you to evaluate commands based on the `R'
programming language.  For this package, special contexts are lines
that start with `#+R:' or `#+RR:'.

     (defun org-R-apply-maybe ()
       "Detect if this is context for org-R and execute R commands."
       (if (save-excursion
             (beginning-of-line 1)
             (looking-at "#\\+RR?:"))
           (progn (call-interactively 'org-R-apply)
                  t) ;; to signal that we took action
         nil)) ;; to signal that we did not

     (add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook 'org-R-apply-maybe)

   The function first checks if the cursor is in such a line.  If that
is the case, `org-R-apply' is called and the function returns `t' to
signal that action was taken, and `C-c C-c' will stop looking for other
contexts.  If the function finds it should do nothing locally, it
returns `nil' so that other, similar functions can have a try.

A.5 Tables and lists in arbitrary syntax
========================================

Since Orgtbl mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables in
specific languages, for example LaTeX.  However, this is extremely hard
to do in a general way, would lead to a customization nightmare, and
would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl-mode table editor.

   This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the Orgtbl
mode table in its native format (the source table), and use a custom
function to translate the table to the correct syntax, and to install
it in the right location (the target table).  This puts the burden of
writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows for a very
flexible system.

   Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists.  You can use
Org's facilities to edit and structure lists by turning `orgstruct-mode'
on, then locally exporting such lists in another format (HTML, LaTeX or
Texinfo.)

* Radio lists::                 Doing the same for lists


File: org,  Node: Radio tables,  Next: A LaTeX example,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.5.1 Radio tables
------------------

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create two
lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic words for
Orgtbl mode to find.  Orgtbl mode will insert the translated table
between these lines, replacing whatever was there before.  For example:

     /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
     /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */

Just above the source table, we put a special line that tells Orgtbl
mode how to translate this table and where to install it.  For example: 
     #+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments....

`table_name' is the reference name for the table that is also used in
the receiver lines. `translation_function' is the Lisp function that
does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can contain a list of
arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.  The arguments will be
passed as a property list to the translation function for
interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and
acted upon before the translation function is called:

`:skip N'
     Skip the first N lines of the table.  Hlines do count as separate
     lines for this parameter!

`:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)'
     List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column
     with calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as
     well.  Please note that the translator function sees the table
     _after_ the removal of these columns, the function never knows
     that there have been additional columns.

The one problem remaining is how to keep the source table in the buffer
without disturbing the normal workings of the file, for example during
compilation of a C file or processing of a LaTeX file.  There are a
number of different solutions:

   * The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported
     by the language.  For example, in C mode you could wrap the table
     between `/*' and `*/' lines.

   * Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of END
     statement, for example `\bye' in TeX and `\end{document}' in LaTeX.

   * You can just comment the table line-by-line whenever you want to
     process the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the
     table.  This only sounds tedious--the command `M-x
     orgtbl-toggle-comment' makes this comment-toggling very easy, in
     particular if you bind it to a key.


File: org,  Node: A LaTeX example,  Next: Translator functions,  Prev: Radio tables,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.5.2 A LaTeX example of radio tables
-------------------------------------

The best way to wrap the source table in LaTeX is to use the `comment'
environment provided by `comment.sty'.  It has to be activated by
placing `\usepackage{comment}' into the document header.  Orgtbl mode
can insert a radio table skeleton(1)  with the command `M-x
orgtbl-insert-radio-table'.  You will be prompted for a table name,
let's say we use `salesfigures'.  You will then get the following
template:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | | |
     \end{comment}

The `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line tells Orgtbl mode to use the function
`orgtbl-to-latex' to convert the table into LaTeX and to put it into
the receiver location with name `salesfigures'.  You may now fill in
the table, feel free to use the spreadsheet features(2):

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     % $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
     \end{comment}

When you are done, press `C-c C-c' in the table to get the converted
table inserted between the two marker lines.

   Now let's assume you want to make the table header by hand, because
you want to control how columns are aligned, etc.  In this case we make
sure that the table translator skips the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a splice, i.e., header and
footer commands of the target table:

     \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
     Month & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Days} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \end{tabular}
     %
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     \end{comment}

   The LaTeX translator function `orgtbl-to-latex' is already part of
Orgtbl mode.  It uses a `tabular' environment to typeset the table and
marks horizontal lines with `\hline'.  Furthermore, it interprets the
following parameters (see also *note Translator functions::):

`:splice nil/t'
     When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
     tabular environment.  Default is nil.

`:fmt fmt'
     A format to be used to wrap each field, it should contain `%s' for
     the original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value
     in dollars, you could use `:fmt "$%s$"'.  This may also be a
     property list with column numbers and formats. for example `:fmt
     (2 "$%s$" 4 "%s\\%%")'.  A function of one argument can be used in
     place of the strings; the function must return a formatted string.

`:efmt efmt'
     Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format
     should have `%s' twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for
     example `"%s\\times10^{%s}"'.  The default is `"%s\\,(%s)"'.  This
     may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for
     example `:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^{%s}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^{%s}$")'.
     After `efmt' has been applied to a value, `fmt' will also be
     applied.  Similar to `fmt', functions of two arguments can be
     supplied instead of strings.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) By default this works only for LaTeX, HTML, and Texinfo.
Configure the variable `orgtbl-radio-tables' to install templates for
other modes.

   (2) If the `#+TBLFM' line contains an odd number of dollar
characters, this may cause problems with font-lock in LaTeX mode.  As
shown in the example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
`comment' environment that is used to balance the dollar expressions.
If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a much better
solution is to add the `comment' environment to the variable
`LaTeX-verbatim-environments'.

A.5.3 Translator functions
--------------------------

Orgtbl mode has several translator functions built-in: `orgtbl-to-csv'
(comma-separated values), `orgtbl-to-tsv' (TAB-separated values)
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-html', and `orgtbl-to-texinfo'.  Except
for `orgtbl-to-html'(1), these all use a generic translator,
`orgtbl-to-generic'.  For example, `orgtbl-to-latex' itself is a very
short function that computes the column definitions for the `tabular'
environment, defines a few field and line separators and then hands
processing over to the generic translator.  Here is the entire code:

     (defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
       "Convert the Orgtbl mode TABLE to LaTeX."
       (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                                    org-table-last-alignment ""))
              (params2
               (list
                :tstart (concat "\\begin{tabular}{" alignment "}")
                :tend "\\end{tabular}"
                :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
                :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
         (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))

   As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
PARAMS) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable PARAMS2).  The ones passed into the function (i.e., ones set
by the `ORGTBL SEND' line) take precedence.  So if you would like to
use the LaTeX translator, but wanted the line endings to be `\\[2mm]'
instead of the default `\\', you could just overrule the default with

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"

   For a new language, you can either write your own converter function
in analogy with the LaTeX translator, or you can use the generic
function directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table
is started with `!BTBL!', ended with `!ETBL!', and where table lines are
started with `!BL!', ended with `!EL!', and where the field separator
is a TAB, you could call the generic translator like this (on a single
line!):

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                                   :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"

Please check the documentation string of the function
`orgtbl-to-generic' for a full list of parameters understood by that
function, and remember that you can pass each of them into
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-texinfo', and any other function using
the generic function.

   Of course you can also write a completely new function doing
complicated things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator
function takes two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list
of lines, each line either the symbol `hline' or a list of fields.  The
second argument is the property list containing all parameters
specified in the `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line.  The function must return a
single string containing the formatted table.  If you write a generally
useful translator, please post it on <emacs-orgmode@gnu.org> so that
others can benefit from your work.

A.5.4 Radio lists
-----------------

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way than
sending and receiving radio tables (*note Radio tables::).  As for
radio tables, you can insert radio lists templates in HTML, LaTeX and
Texinfo modes by calling `org-list-insert-radio-list'.

   Here are the differences with radio tables:

   - Use `ORGLST' instead of `ORGTBL'.

   - The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
     parameters.

   - `C-c C-c' will work when pressed on the first item of the list.

   Here is a LaTeX example.  Let's say that you have this in your LaTeX
file:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     % END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGLIST: SEND to-buy orgtbl-to-latex
     - a new house
     - a new computer
       + a new keyboard
       + a new mouse
     - a new life
     \end{comment}

   Pressing `C-c C-c' on `a new house' and will insert the converted
LaTeX list between the two marker lines.


File: org,  Node: Dynamic blocks,  Next: Special agenda views,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Hacking

A.6 Dynamic blocks
==================

Org documents can contain _dynamic blocks_.  These are specially marked
regions that are updated by some user-written function.  A good example
for such a block is the clock table inserted by the command `C-c C-x
C-r' (*note Clocking work time::).

   Dynamic block are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a
name to the block and can also specify parameters for the function
producing the content of the block.

   #+BEGIN:dynamic block
     #+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

     #+END:

   Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands

`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamic block at point.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.

   Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between BEGIN
and END, parse the BEGIN line for parameters and then call the specific
writer function for this block to insert the new content.  If you want
to use the original content in the writer function, you can use the
extra parameter `:content'.

   For a block with name `myblock', the writer function is
`org-dblock-write:myblock' with as only parameter a property list with
the parameters given in the begin line.  Here is a trivial example of a
block that keeps track of when the block update function was last run:

     #+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

     #+END:

The corresponding block writer function could look like this:

     (defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
        (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
          (insert "Last block update at: "
                  (format-time-string fmt (current-time)))))

   If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always
up-to-date, you could add the function `org-update-all-dblocks' to a
hook, for example `before-save-hook'.  `org-update-all-dblocks' is
written in a way such that it does nothing in buffers that are not in
`org-mode'.


File: org,  Node: Special agenda views,  Next: Extracting agenda information,  Prev: Dynamic blocks,  Up: Hacking

A.7 Special agenda views
========================

Org provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the
selection made by any of the agenda views.  You may specify a function
that is used at each match to verify if the match should indeed be part
of the agenda view, and if not, how much should be skipped.

   Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a
WAITING tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that
you have marked all tree headings that define a project with the TODO
keyword PROJECT.  In this case you would run a TODO search for the
keyword PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a WAITING tag
anywhere in the subtree belonging to the project line.

   To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree
for the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return `nil' to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

     (defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
       "Skip trees that are not waiting"
       (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
         (if (re-search-forward ":waiting:" subtree-end t)
             nil          ; tag found, do not skip
           subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree

   Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for
example like this:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-skip-unless-waiting)
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   Note that this also binds `org-agenda-overriding-header' to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

   A general way to create custom searches is to base them on a search
for entries with a certain level limit.  If you want to study all
entries with your custom search function, simply do a search for
`LEVEL>0'(1), and then use `org-agenda-skip-function' to select the
entries you really want to have.

   You may also put a Lisp form into `org-agenda-skip-function'.  In
particular, you may use the functions `org-agenda-skip-entry-if' and
`org-agenda-skip-subtree-if' in this form, for example:

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'timestamp)'
     Skip current entry if it has any timestamp, may also be deadline
     or scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry 'notregexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.

`'(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.

   Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                     'regexp ":waiting:"))
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that, when using `org-odd-levels-only', a level number
corresponds to order in the hierarchy, not to the number of stars.


File: org,  Node: Extracting agenda information,  Next: Using the property API,  Prev: Special agenda views,  Up: Hacking

A.8 Extracting agenda information
=================================

Org provides commands to access agenda information for the command line
in Emacs batch mode.  This extracted information can be sent directly
to a printer, or it can be read by a program that does further
processing of the data.  The first of these commands is the function
`org-batch-agenda', that produces an agenda view and sends it as ASCII
text to STDOUT.  The command takes a single string as parameter.  If
the string has length 1, it is used as a key to one of the commands you
have configured in `org-agenda-custom-commands', basically any key you
can use after `C-c a'.  For example, to directly print the current TODO
list, you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr

   If the parameter is a string with 2 or more characters, it is used
as a tags/TODO match string.  For example, to print your local shopping
list (all items with the tag `shop', but excluding the tag `NewYork'),
you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
           -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr

You may also modify parameters on the fly like this:

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
        -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a"                               \
                 org-agenda-ndays 30                               \
                 org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                 org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
        | lpr

which will produce a 30-day agenda, fully restricted to the Org file
`~/org/projects.org', not even including the diary.

   If you want to process the agenda data in more sophisticated ways,
you can use the command `org-batch-agenda-csv' to get a comma-separated
list of values for each agenda item.  Each line in the output will
contain a number of fields separated by commas.  The fields in a line
are:

     category     The category of the item
     head         The headline, without TODO keyword, TAGS and PRIORITY
     type         The type of the agenda entry, can be
                     todo               selected in TODO match
                     tagsmatch          selected in tags match
                     diary              imported from diary
                     deadline           a deadline
                     scheduled          scheduled
                     timestamp          appointment, selected by timestamp
                     closed             entry was closed on date
                     upcoming-deadline  warning about nearing deadline
                     past-scheduled     forwarded scheduled item
                     block              entry has date block including date
     todo         The TODO keyword, if any
     tags         All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons
     date         The relevant date, like 2007-2-14
     time         The time, like 15:00-16:50
     extra        String with extra planning info
     priority-l   The priority letter if any was given
     priority-n   The computed numerical priority

Time and date will only be given if a timestamp (or deadline/scheduled)
led to the selection of the item.

   A CSV list like this is very easy to use in a post-processing script.
For example, here is a Perl program that gets the TODO list from
Emacs/Org and prints all the items, preceded by a checkbox:

     #!/usr/bin/perl

     # define the Emacs command to run
     $cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

     # run it and capture the output
     $agenda = qx{$cmd 2>/dev/null};

     # loop over all lines
     foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) {
       # get the individual values
       ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
        $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);
       # process and print
       print "[ ] $head\n";
     }


File: org,  Node: Using the property API,  Next: Using the mapping API,  Prev: Extracting agenda information,  Up: Hacking

A.9 Using the property API
==========================

Here is a description of the functions that can be used to work with
properties.

 -- Function: org-entry-properties &optional pom which
     Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.
     This includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for
     deadline, scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties
     defined in the entry.  The return value is an alist, keys may
     occur multiple times if the property key was used several times.
     POM may also be nil, in which case the current entry is used.  If
     WHICH is nil or `all', get all properties.  If WHICH is `special'
     or `standard', only get that subclass.
   
 -- Function: org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
     Get value of PROPERTY for entry at point-or-marker POM.  By
     default, this only looks at properties defined locally in the
     entry.  If INHERIT is non-nil and the entry does not have the
     property, then also check higher levels of the hierarchy.  If
     INHERIT is the symbol `selective', use inheritance if and only if
     the setting of `org-use-property-inheritance' selects PROPERTY for
     inheritance.

 -- Function: org-entry-delete pom property
     Delete the property PROPERTY from entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-entry-put pom property value
     Set PROPERTY to VALUE for entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
     Get all property keys in the current buffer.

 -- Function: org-insert-property-drawer
     Insert a property drawer at point.

 -- Function: org-entry-put-multivalued-property pom property &rest
          values
     Set PROPERTY at point-or-marker POM to VALUES.  VALUES should be a
     list of strings.  They will be concatenated, with spaces as
     separators.

 -- Function: org-entry-get-multivalued-property pom property
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and return the values as a list of strings.

 -- Function: org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property pom property value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and make sure that VALUE is in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-remove-from-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and make sure that VALUE is _not_ in this list.

 -- Function: org-entry-member-in-multivalued-property pom property
          value
     Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated
     list of values and check if VALUE is in this list.


File: org,  Node: Using the mapping API,  Prev: Using the property API,  Up: Hacking

A.10 Using the mapping API
==========================

Org has sophisticated mapping capabilities to find all entries
satisfying certain criteria.  Internally, this functionality is used to
produce agenda views, but there is also an API that can be used to
execute arbitrary functions for each or selected entries.  The main
entry point for this API is:

 -- Function: org-map-entries func &optional match scope &rest skip
     Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.

     FUNC is a function or a Lisp form.  The function will be called
     without arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of
     the headline.  The return values of all calls to the function will
     be collected and returned as a list.

     The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so
     FUNC does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the
     cursor will be moved to the end of the line (presumably of the
     headline of the processed entry) and search continues from there.
     Under some circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.
     For example, if you have removed (e.g., mean that the next entry
     will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you can specify the
     position from where search should continue by making FUNC set the
     variable `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer position.

     MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda
     match view.  Only headlines that are matched by this query will be
     considered during the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all
     headlines will be visited by the iteration.

     SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

          nil     the current buffer, respecting the restriction if any
          tree    the subtree started with the entry at point
          file    the current buffer, without restriction
          file-with-archives
                  the current buffer, and any archives associated with it
          agenda  all agenda files
          agenda-with-archives
                  all agenda files with any archive files associated with them
          (file1 file2 ...)
                  if this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned
     The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping
     facilities of the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

          archive   skip trees with the archive tag
          comment   skip trees with the COMMENT keyword
          function or Lisp form
                    will be used as value for `org-agenda-skip-function',
                    so whenever the function returns t, FUNC
                    will not be called for that entry and search will
                    continue from the point where the function leaves it

   The function given to that mapping routine can really do anything
you like.  It can use the property API (*note Using the property API::)
to gather more information about the entry, or in order to change
metadata in the entry.  Here are a couple of functions that might be
handy:

 -- Function: org-todo &optional arg
     Change the TODO state of the entry, see the docstring of the
     functions for the many possible values for the argument ARG.

 -- Function: org-priority &optional action
     Change the priority of the entry, see the docstring of this
     function for the possible values for ACTION.

 -- Function: org-toggle-tag tag &optional onoff
     Toggle the tag TAG in the current entry.  Setting ONOFF to either
     `on' or `off' will not toggle tag, but ensure that it is either on
     or off.

 -- Function: org-promote
     Promote the current entry.

 -- Function: org-demote
     Demote the current entry.

   Here is a simple example that will turn all entries in the current
file with a tag `TOMORROW' into TODO entries with the keyword
`UPCOMING'.  Entries in comment trees and in archive trees will be
ignored.

     (org-map-entries
        '(org-todo "UPCOMING")
        "+TOMORROW" 'file 'archive 'comment)

   The following example counts the number of entries with TODO keyword
`WAITING', in all agenda files.

     (length (org-map-entries t "/+WAITING" 'agenda))

Appendix B MobileOrg
********************

MobileOrg is an application for the iPhone/iPod Touch series of
devices, developed by Richard Moreland.  Instead of trying to implement
the full feature set of Org and fighting with synchronization issues,
this application chooses a different path.  MobileOrg provides offline
viewing and capture support for an Org-mode system rooted on a "real"
computer.  Synchronization issues are avoided by making MobileOrg only
write to a special capture file, that is only read by the
computer-based system.

   This appendix describes the support Org has for creating agenda
views in a format that can be displayed by MobileOrg, and for
integrating notes captured by MobileOrg into the main system.  It does
not cover the operation of MobileOrg itself (see
`http://ncogni.to/mobileorg/').

* Pushing to MobileOrg::        Uploading Org files and agendas
* Pulling from MobileOrg::      Integrating captured and flagged items


File: org,  Node: Setting up the staging area,  Next: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Prev: MobileOrg,  Up: MobileOrg

B.1 Setting up the staging area
===============================

Org-mode has commands to prepare a directory with files for MobileOrg,
and to read captured notes from there.  If Emacs can directly write to
the WebDAV directory accessed by MobileOrg, all you need to do is to
point to this directory using the variable `org-mobile-directory'.

   If Emacs cannot access the WebDAV directory directly, you can use a
local directory for staging.  Other means must then be used to keep
this directory in sync with the WebDAV directory.  In the following
example, files are staged in `~/stage', and Org-mode hooks take care of
moving files to and from the WebDAV directory using `scp'.

     (setq org-mobile-directory "~/stage/")
     (add-hook 'org-mobile-post-push-hook
       (lambda ()
        (shell-command "scp ~/stage/* user@webdavhost:mobile/")))
     (add-hook 'org-mobile-pre-pull-hook
       (lambda ()
        (shell-command "scp user@webdavhost:mobile/mobileorg.org ~/stage/ ")))
     (add-hook 'org-mobile-post-pull-hook
       (lambda ()
        (shell-command "scp ~/stage/mobileorg.org user@webdavhost:mobile/")))


File: org,  Node: Pushing to MobileOrg,  Next: Pulling from MobileOrg,  Prev: Setting up the staging area,  Up: MobileOrg

B.2 Pushing to MobileOrg
========================

This operation copies all files currently listed in `org-mobile-files'
to the directory `org-mobile-directory'.  By default this list contains
all agenda files (as listed in `org-agenda-files'), but additional files
can be included by customizing `org-mobiles-files'.  The push operation
also creates (in the same directory) a special Org file `agendas.org'.
This file is an Org-mode style outline, containing every custom agenda
view defined by the user.  While creating the agendas, Org-mode will
force(1) an ID property on all entries referenced by the agendas, so
that these entries can be uniquely identified if MobileOrg flags them
for further action.  Finally, Org writes the file `index.org',
containing links to all other files.  If MobileOrg is configured to
request this file from the WebDAV server, all agendas and Org files
will be downloaded to the iPhone.  To speed up the download, MobileOrg
will only read files whose checksums(2) have changed.

B.3 Pulling from MobileOrg
==========================

When MobileOrg synchronizes with the WebDAV server, it not only pulls
the Org files for viewing.  It also appends captured entries and
pointers to flagged entries to the file `mobileorg.org' on the server.
Org has a _pull_ operation that integrates this information into an
inbox file and operates on the pointers to flagged entries.  Here is
how it works:

  1. Org moves all entries found in `mobileorg.org'(1) and appends them
     to the file pointed to by the variable
     `org-mobile-inbox-for-pull'.  Each captured entry will be a
     top-level entry in the inbox file.

  2. After moving the entries, Org will attempt to act on the flags.
     Some flags specify simple operations that will be executed
     directly and without user interaction.  Examples are marking an
     entry as DONE and/or archiving it(2).  All other flagged entries
     will receive a tag `:FLAGGED:', so that they can be easily found
     again.  When there is a problem finding the entry that should be
     flagged, the pointer entry will remain in the inbox and will be
     marked with an error message.

  3. Org will then generate an agenda view with all flagged entries.
     The user should then go through these entries and do whatever
     actions are necessary.  If a note has been stored while flagging
     an entry in MobileOrg, that note will be displayed in the echo
     area when the cursor is on the corresponding agenda line.
    `?'
          Pressing `?' in that special agenda will display the full
          flagging note in another window and also push it onto the
          kill ring.  So you could use `?  z C-y C-c C-c' to store that
          flagging note as a normal note in the entry.  Pressing `?'
          twice in succession will offer to remove the `:FLAGGED:' tag
          along with the recorded flagging note (which is stored in a
          property).

   If you are not able to process all flagged entries directly, you can
always return to this agenda view using `C-c a ?'.  Note, however, that
there is a subtle difference.  The view created automatically by `M-x
org-mobile-pull RET' is guaranteed to search all files that have been
addressed by the last pull.  This might include a file that is not
currently in your list of agenda files.  If you later use `C-c a ?' to
regenerate the view, only the current agenda files will be searched.

Appendix C History and Acknowledgments
**************************************

Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface of the
Emacs Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and projects,
and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However, having to
remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per command,
only to hide and show parts of the outline tree, that seemed entirely
unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly wanted to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  _Visibility cycling_ and _structure editing_ were
originally implemented in the package `outline-magic.el', but quickly
moved to the more general `org.el'.  As this environment became
comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding _TODO
entries_, basic _timestamps_, and _table support_.  These areas
highlighted the two main goals that Org still has today: to be a new,
outline-based, plain text mode with innovative and intuitive editing
features, and to incorporate project planning functionality directly
into a notes file.

   A special thanks goes to Bastien Guerry who has not only written a
large number of extensions to Org (most of them integrated into the
core by now), but who has also helped in the development and
maintenance of Org so much that he should be considered the main
co-contributor to this package.

   Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to
<emacs-orgmode@gnu.org> have provided a constant stream of bug reports,
feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.  Many
thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am trying
to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence in
shaping one or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be complete, if I
have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me know.

   * Russel Adams came up with the idea for drawers.

   * Thomas Baumann wrote `org-bbdb.el' and `org-mhe.el'.

   * Christophe Bataillon created the great unicorn logo that we use on
     the Org-mode website.

   * Alex Bochannek provided a patch for rounding timestamps.

   * Brad Bozarth showed how to pull RSS feed data into Org-mode files.

   * Tom Breton wrote `org-choose.el'.

   * Charles Cave's suggestion sparked the implementation of templates
     for Remember.

   * Pavel Chalmoviansky influenced the agenda treatment of items with
     specified time.

   * Gregory Chernov patched support for Lisp forms into table
     calculations and improved XEmacs compatibility, in particular by
     porting `nouline.el' to XEmacs.

   * Sacha Chua suggested copying some linking code from Planner.

   * Baoqiu Cui contributed the DocBook exporter.

   * Eddward DeVilla proposed and tested checkbox statistics.  He also
     came up with the idea of properties, and that there should be an
     API for them.

   * Nick Dokos tracked down several nasty bugs.

   * Kees Dullemond used to edit projects lists directly in HTML and so
     inspired some of the early development, including HTML export.  He
     also asked for a way to narrow wide table columns.

   * Christian Egli converted the documentation into Texinfo format,
     patched CSS formatting into the HTML exporter, and inspired the
     agenda.

   * David Emery provided a patch for custom CSS support in exported
     HTML agendas.

   * Nic Ferrier contributed mailcap and XOXO support.

   * Miguel A. Figueroa-Villanueva implemented hierarchical checkboxes.

   * John Foerch figured out how to make incremental search show context
     around a match in a hidden outline tree.

   * Niels Giesen had the idea to automatically archive DONE trees.

   * Bastien Guerry wrote the LaTeX exporter and `org-bibtex.el', and
     has been prolific with patches, ideas, and bug reports.

   * Kai Grossjohann pointed out key-binding conflicts with other
     packages.

   * Bernt Hansen has driven much of the support for auto-repeating
     tasks, task state change logging, and the clocktable.  His clear
     explanations have been critical when we started to adopt the Git
     version control system.

   * Manuel Hermenegildo has contributed various ideas, small fixes and
     patches.

   * Phil Jackson wrote `org-irc.el'.

   * Scott Jaderholm proposed footnotes, control over whitespace between
     folded entries, and column view for properties.

   * Tokuya Kameshima wrote `org-wl.el' and `org-mew.el'.

   * Shidai Liu ("Leo") asked for embedded LaTeX and tested it.  He also
     provided frequent feedback and some patches.

   * Matt Lundin has proposed last-row references for table formulas
     and named invisible anchors.  He has also worked a lot on the FAQ.

   * Jason F. McBrayer suggested agenda export to CSV format.

   * Max Mikhanosha came up with the idea of refiling.

   * Dmitri Minaev sent a patch to set priority limits on a per-file
     basis.

   * Stefan Monnier provided a patch to keep the Emacs-Lisp compiler
     happy.

   * Richard Moreland wrote MobileOrg for the iPhone.

   * Rick Moynihan proposed allowing multiple TODO sequences in a file
     and being able to quickly restrict the agenda to a subtree.

   * Todd Neal provided patches for links to Info files and Elisp forms.

   * Greg Newman refreshed the unicorn logo into its current form.

   * Tim O'Callaghan suggested in-file links, search options for general
     file links, and TAGS.

   * Takeshi Okano translated the manual and David O'Toole's tutorial
     into Japanese.

   * Oliver Oppitz suggested multi-state TODO items.

   * Scott Otterson sparked the introduction of descriptive text for
     links, among other things.

   * Pete Phillips helped during the development of the TAGS feature,
     and provided frequent feedback.

   * Martin Pohlack provided the code snippet to bundle character
     insertion into bundles of 20 for undo.

   * T.V. Raman reported bugs and suggested improvements.

   * Matthias Rempe (Oelde) provided ideas, Windows support, and quality
     control.

   * Paul Rivier provided the basic implementation of named footnotes.

   * Kevin Rogers contributed code to access VM files on remote hosts.

   * Sebastian Rose wrote `org-info.js', a Java script for displaying
     webpages derived from Org using an Info-like or a folding
     interface with single-key navigation.

   * Frank Ruell solved the mystery of the `keymapp nil' bug, a
     conflict with `allout.el'.

   * Jason Riedy generalized the send-receive mechanism for Orgtbl
     tables with extensive patches.

   * Philip Rooke created the Org reference card, provided lots of
     feedback, developed and applied standards to the Org documentation.

   * Christian Schlauer proposed angular brackets around links, among
     other things.

   * Eric Schulte wrote `org-plot.el' and contributed various patches,
     small features and modules.

   * Linking to VM/BBDB/Gnus was first inspired by Tom Shannon's
     `organizer-mode.el'.

   * Ilya Shlyakhter proposed the Archive Sibling, line numbering in
     literal examples, and remote highlighting for referenced code
     lines.

   * Stathis Sideris wrote the `ditaa.jar' ASCII to PNG converter that
     is now packaged into Org's `contrib' directory.

   * Daniel Sinder came up with the idea of internal archiving by
     locking subtrees.

   * Dale Smith proposed link abbreviations.

   * James TD Smith has contributed a large number of patches for useful
     tweaks and features.

   * Adam Spiers asked for global linking commands, inspired the link
     extension system, added support for mairix, and proposed the
     mapping API.

   * Andy Stewart contributed code to `org-w3m.el', to copy HTML content
     with links transformation to Org syntax.

   * David O'Toole wrote `org-publish.el' and drafted the manual
     chapter about publishing.

   * Ju"rgen Vollmer contributed code generating the table of contents
     in HTML output.

   * Chris Wallace provided a patch implementing the `QUOTE' keyword.

   * David Wainberg suggested archiving, and improvements to the linking
     system.

   * John Wiegley wrote `emacs-wiki.el', `planner.el', and `muse.el',
     which have some overlap with Org.  Initially the development of
     Org was fully independent because I was not aware of the existence
     of these packages.  But with time I have occasionally looked at
     John's code and learned a lot from it.  John has also contributed
     a number of great ideas and patches directly to Org, including the
     attachment system (`org-attach.el'), integration with Apple Mail
     (`org-mac-message.el'), and hierarchical dependencies of TODO
     items.

   * Carsten Wimmer suggested some changes and helped fix a bug in
     linking to Gnus.

   * Roland Winkler requested additional key bindings to make Org work
     on a tty.

   * Piotr Zielinski wrote `org-mouse.el', proposed agenda blocks and
     contributed various ideas and code snippets.
